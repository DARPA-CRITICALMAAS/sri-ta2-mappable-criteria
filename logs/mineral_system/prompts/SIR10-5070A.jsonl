This report also describes the geoenvironmental char- acteristic of MVT deposits. The response of MVT ores in  the supergene environment is buffered by their placement in  carbonate host rocks which commonly results in near-neutral  associated drainage water. The geoenvironmental features and  anthropogenic mining effects presented in this report illustrates  this important environmental aspect of MVT deposits which  separates them from other deposit types (especially coal,  VHMS, Cu-porphyry, SEDEX, acid-sulfate polymetallic vein).

MVT deposits generally exhibit abundant evidence for an  epigenetic and replacement nature to the ores. However, the  distinction between some SEDEX and MVT deposits can be  quite subjective because some SEDEX ores replaced sedi- ments in an early or burial diagenetic environment whereas  some MVT deposits formed in an early diagenetic environ- ment and display laminated ore textures.

Historical Evolution of Descriptive and  Genetic Knowledge and Concepts Early models for MVT ores called upon ore formation by  dilute meteoric groundwater, magmatic, and connate fluids,  and invoked processes that ranged from synsedimentary-  exhalative to supergene activity involving meteoric water.  Sharp divisions of opinion existed between geologists who  believed the ores were syngenetic, early diagenetic, or epi- genetic in origin.

Modern thoughts on the origin of MVT deposits began  with fluid inclusion studies that showed the ore fluids were  similar to oil-field brines (Newhouse, 1933; Hall and Fried- man, 1963; Roedder and others, 1963; White, 1968). A major  step in understanding their genesis was the suggestion that  they formed by the mixing of multiple basinal fluids with  contrasting reduced sulfur and metal content (for example,  Dunham, 1966). Early models assumed that MVT deposits  had no connection with tectonic processes.

Therefore, 97 percent  of MVT Pb and Zn metal was generated within these two time  periods.  Based on the deposits that have been dated (Leach  and others, 2001), it appears that few MVT deposits were  formed during periods of major plate dispersal represented  by the Neoproterozoic to early Paleozoic period or during the  rapid breakup of Pangea in Triassic through Jurassic time.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Ancient carbonate platforms consisted primarily  of stromatolites and sea-floor precipitates (Grotzinger and  James, 2000). Synsedimentary lithification, early diagenetic  dolomitization and silicification, lack of bioturbation, and  coarse skeletal carbonate debris, render these platform car- bonate successions impermeable (Grotzinger, 1989).

Therefore, there are no typical dimen- sions. Some examples of deposit dimensions are: 1.  Deposits located in carbonate dissolution collapse   breccias and associated features may take the form of  individual collapse breccia bodies. In the Pine Point  district for example, the plan views of the deposits are  circular to oval expressions of collapse breccia bodies that  are several tens to hundreds of meters in diameter (Skall,  1975; Hannigan, 2007).

This interrelationship exists because sulfide precipitation is  nearly always an acid-generating process. Ore textures from  MVT deposits can be highly complex due to commonly  inherited fabrics of the replaced host rock and the ore-forming  processes. The ores can be extremely fine grained but in some  districts crystals can be as large as a meter or more (for  example, Tri-State and Central Tennessee districts). The most important ore mineral textures include the   following features.

Consequently, hydrothermal dissolu- tion features and replacement halos are common in and about  MVT deposits. The most significant acid production occurs as  a consequence of the mixing of reduced sulfur-bearing fluids  with a metal-bearing fluid and, to a lesser extent, by sulfate  reduction in the ore zone.

Temperature also affects  chemical reaction rates, from the initiation of iron sulfide oxi- dation to the dissolution of other sulfides by the resulting acid.  The release rate of trace metals is a function of the trace  metal content, the mineral phase in which the trace element  is present, and the pH of the mine outflow (Lapakko, 1992).  As important as the iron sulfide content is to the formation of  acid, so is the presence of the carbonate host-rock important  to neutralizing the acid. MVT deposits and other carbonate- hosted deposits (for example, skarns) contain more buffering  capacity for acid than any other deposit type, and the drainage  from them is often circum-neutral in pH.

Erickson and others (1983)  also described a systematic change of increasing Zn/Pb from  insoluble residues of barren carbonate from the lower-most to  upper-most carbonates in the stratigraphic section in the region.  Fluid Inclusion Thermometry and Geochemistry Temperature of the Ore Fluids    Fluid inclusion temperatures in MVT deposits range from  about 50\u00b0C to 250\u00b0C; however, most of the temperatures are  between 75\u00b0C and 200\u00b0C (fig. 8).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

These ranges are similar to  values determined by Basuki and Spooner (2004). The highest  fluid inclusion temperatures (~180\u00b0C to ~ 250\u00b0C) recorded  are for the Irish Midlands district and Gays River deposit, ores  that were relatively near each other during ore deposition but  drifted apart during the opening of the Atlantic (Leach and  others, 2001). In many districts (for example, the deposits in  the Ozarks region in the Midcontinent United States, Irish  Midlands, Upper Silesia, and C\u00e8vennes districts), the fluid  inclusion temperatures generally exceed values expected  for geologically reasonable thermal gradients and estimated  stratigraphic burial temperatures at the time of mineralization.  Therefore, the temperatures observed for many ore deposits  must be explained by unusually high geothermal gradients,  advective heat transport from deeper parts of the basin (as with  the Ozark MVT province), or the ascent of deeply circulating  fluids in basement rocks beneath the deposits (for example,  Upper Silesia and Irish Midlands).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Given  the complexities possible for sulfur isotope fractionation,  extreme variations in the \u03b434S values (fig. 11) are expected.

As discussed previously, the  reduced sulfur content is the dominant control on the concen- tration of metals in MVT ore fluids, thus low reduced-sulfur  sedimentary brines will have greater potential to extract met- als from a variety of lithologies. Therefore, geological and  geochemical features that buffer the redox state of aqueous  sulfur species must be considered in resource assessments.  Most MVT ore fluids are believed to have been in equi- librium with carbonate-bearing lithologies which limits the pH  values greater than \u2248 4.5 to 5 under most MVT pressures and  temperatures. However if the fluids are in equilibrium with  crystalline rocks, lower pH can be achieved and therefore,  more reduced sulfur and higher metal contents are possible.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Fluid-Drive Mechanisms The fluid-drive mechanisms proposed for MVT depos- its are numerous and include topography-driven, sediment  compaction, orogenic squeezing, overpressured gas reservoirs,  and thermal and density reflux drives. Leach and others (2001)  considered the implications of fluid flow mechanisms from  the perspective of the ages of MVT ore formation and con- cluded that no single mechanism can be applied to all districts.  However, the most robust mechanism for many MVT districts  is topography-driven fluid flow. Support for this comes from  the ages of MVT ore genesis that often coincide with the time  of orogenesis of adjacent uplifted margins of foreland and  intracratonic basins.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Nature of Traps and Geological Controls that  Trigger Ore Precipitation The ore controls recognized for selected MVT dis- tricts are shown in figure 3.

Each ore-controlling feature typically has an  unmineralized counterpart in each district, suggesting that the  coincidence of several controls must have been important in  localizing ore. The various controls are generally interrelated.

The complex interplay  between sulfide deposition, acid generation, and hydrothermal  brecciation with pre-ore carbonate dissolution features is  discussed by Leach and others (2003). In nearly all MVT  districts, preexisting solution-collapse breccias and related  carbonate-dissolution features provide high permeability  zones that facilitate effective fluid mixing and ore deposi- tion.

The chemical nature of Zn  allows it to stay in solution and remain mobile at near-neutral  pH (Smith, 1999).

Sulfate is commonly the major anionic  component in MVT drainage water. Smith and Schumacher  (1991) reported a maximum concentration of 850 mg/L in Old  Lead Belt mine-waste seeps. Wirt and others (2001) reported  up to 11,000 mg/L sulfate, with a median of 360 mg/L from  Upper Silesia district mine seeps. There are several possible reasons for the higher metal  and sulfate concentrations in the high-Fe-sulfide deposit seeps.  First, the pyrite itself can contain high concentrations of trace  elements such as As, Co, Ni, or Tl. In addition, the higher  pyrite content generates greater amounts of sulfuric acid, and  local low-pH conditions at mineral surfaces dissolve greater  quantities of the primary sulfides and their contained trace  elements.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Decreasing precipitation may affect the  ability of streams to dilute metal concentrations; increasing  precipitation may result in episodes of rapid runoff and ero- sion, thereby increasing sediment and metal loads in streams.  Mining Methods  The current methods used for mining MVT deposits are  room-and-pillar, or longwall techniques (Foley, 2002). The  room-and-pillar method is suitable for stratiform deposits, the  type which typifies MVTs. This method results in a checker- board pattern of mined rooms, supported by pillars of unmined  rock (Bateman, 1942).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Historically, the longwall  method was applied to some deposits. The longwall method  consists of developing a central shaft, and mining many faces,  starting from a peripheral tunnel, towards the central shaft.  This method essentially recovered all the ore, and allowed  subsidence of the mined rooms as the faces retreated towards  the central shaft (Bateman, 1942). In the past, open-pit meth- ods were also used for some near-surface deposits.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Ore Processing Methods Early ore processing consisted of crushing and grinding  the ore, and using gravity separation techniques such as jig- ging or concentrator tables. One of the drawbacks of gravity  techniques was incomplete removal of sulfides from coarse  tailings and slimes. Slimes are very finely ground material,  on the order of < 250 micrometers (\u03bcm), and are problematic  to dispose of because gravity tailings contain unrecovered  sulfides, and slimes fill in interstitial spaces in stream-bottom  substrate, impairing aquatic habitat.

Mass wasting can introduce material  into a waterway where contaminants are then transported as  solids in bottom sediment, in suspension, or in the dissolved  phase. Rainwater and snowmelt runoff can transport dissolved  and suspended metals off of waste and tailings piles into  nearby streams. Direct wind transport may occur from dried  waste and tailings piles. Channel-bar deposits or overbank- flood deposits that include mine waste can also subsequently  release contaminants to wind transport. Whereas dissolved transport of metals in the water  column can result in concentrations exceeding water-quality  standards, often 90 percent or more of the total metal load  is transported in the solid phase, either detritally as mineral  grains, or sorbed to particle surfaces or as particle coatings  (Miller, 1996).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

We thank the authors of these reports for their various con- tributions to the understanding of MVT ores. The first author  especially thanks Don Sangster for the many years of collabo- rations and numerous discussions on the geology and genesis  of Mississippi Valley-Type ores. Don\u2019s enormous contribution  to the understanding of sediment-hosted ores has contributed  to this manuscript in many ways. He compiled the information  on metal endowments of Pb-Zn deposits in Leach and others  (2005) which was updated by Taylor and others (2009).    St. Joe mill-tailings samples were collected by Robert Lopaka  Lee and Phil Hageman.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Because production and reserve data for MVT  deposits, particularly in the U.S., are commonly presented only as district totals, the size, grade,  and metal-ratio parameters for individual deposits are difficult to compile. For example, the  Viburnum Trend and Old Lead Belt deposits in table A2 are effectively production units within  a mineralized zone that is continuous for more than 120 km.  Therefore, grade-tonnage models  for MVT deposits must take into account the district scale of mineralization along with individ- ual deposit data. Assessments based solely on deposit data may misrepresent the actual resource  defined by MVT mineralization. Grade-tonnage data for all known MVT deposits are available from Leach and others  (2005) and Taylor and others (2009).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?
