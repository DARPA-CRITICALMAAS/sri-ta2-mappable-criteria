========== pathway ==========
SIR10-5070A
1. Faults and fractures: Faults and fractures are important controls in most MVT districts. Ore is localized in dilatancy zones associated with faults. Transtensional faults, wrench faults, and strike-slip faults are particularly favorable.
2. Dissolution-collapse breccias: Dissolution-collapse breccias are the most common host for MVT ores. Preexisting solution-collapse breccias and related carbonate-dissolution features provide high permeability zones that facilitate effective fluid mixing and ore deposition.
3. Lithological transitions: Dramatic changes in both vertical and lateral permeability of the rocks in a carbonate platform sequence, such as transitions from shale to carbonate, limestone to dolostone, and sandstone to carbonates, are important controls on MVT ore deposition.
4. Karstification: Presence of meteoric or hydrothermal karst features can indicate proximity to MVT ore depositional sites.
5. Aquitards and aquifers: Presence of regional aquitards (fine-grained limestone and shales) with overlying and underlying aquifers provide important controls on fluid migration and ore deposition.
6. Evaporite facies: Evidence of evaporative facies, such as gypsum and salt casts, in regional carbonates can indicate favorable conditions for MVT mineralization.
7. Sparry hydrothermal dolomite: Presence of regional sparry hydrothermal dolomite is a favorable factor for MVT mineralization.
8. Geochemical zoning: Primary geochemical zoning of metal deposition in MVT deposits is limited but can provide important information on fluid flow pathways and depositional processes.
9. Gravity and magnetic anomalies: Regional gravity and magnetic data can be useful for mapping basement depth and composition, as well as delineating subsurface fault zones that may have provided pathways for ore fluids.
10. Geochemical halos: Insoluble residue analyses of soils, stream sediment geochemistry, and boulder tracing studies can be used to detect geochemical halos associated with MVT mineralization.
11. Fluid inclusion temperatures: Fluid inclusion temperatures can provide insights into the thermal history of MVT deposits and the geothermal gradients that influenced ore formation.
12. Strontium isotopes: Strontium isotopes can be used to trace fluid flow directions and provide information on fluid mixing and interaction with different rock formations.
13. Organic matter: Increased abundance of organic matter in carbonate rocks or thermally altered organic matter may indicate the effects of hot sedimentary brines and the passage of fluids.
14. Hydrothermal alteration: Hydrothermal alteration, including dissolution and hydrothermal brecciation of the host carbonates, dolomite or calcite alteration, and the presence of hydrothermal cement, can provide constraints on fluid pathways and ore deposition.
15. Fluid-drive mechanisms: Fluid-drive mechanisms, such as topography-driven fluid flow, sediment compaction, orogenic squeezing, overpressured gas reservoirs, and thermal and density reflux drives, can influence the migration and deposition of ore fluids in MVT deposits.
16. Traps and geological controls: Fundamental factors in fluid transmissivity, such as lithology transitions, faults and fractures, dissolution-collapse breccias, and aquitards, create opportunities for ore deposition in MVT deposits.
