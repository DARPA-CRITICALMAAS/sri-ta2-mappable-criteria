The most important characteristics of MVT ore deposits  are that they are hosted mainly by dolostone and limestone   in platform carbonate sequences and usually located at flanks  of basins, orogenic forelands, or foreland thrust belts inboard  of the clastic rock-dominated passive margin sequences. They  have no spatial or temporal relation to igneous rocks, which  distinguishes them from skarn or other intrusive rock-related  Pb-Zn ores. Abundant evidence has shown that the ore fluids  were derived mainly from evaporated seawater and were  driven within platform carbonates by large-scale tectonic  events.  MVT deposits formed mainly during the Phanerozoic  with more than 80 percent of the deposits hosted in Phanero- zoic rocks and less than 20 percent in Precambrian rocks.\"\n\"percent salts;   (9) they have crustal sources for metals and sulfur; (10) tem- peratures of ore deposition are typically 75\u00b0C to about 200\u00b0C;  (11) the most important ore controls are faults and fractures,  dissolution collapse breccias, and lithological transitions;   (12) sulfides are coarsely crystalline to fine grained, massive  to disseminated; (13) the sulfides occur mainly as replacement  of carbonate rocks and to a lesser extent, open-space fill; and  (14) alteration consists mainly of dolomitization, host-rock  dissolution, and brecciation.  As noted by Sangster (1990) and discussed by Leach and  others (2001; 2005) and Kesler and Reich (2006), most MVT  deposits are hosted in Phanerozoic rocks and the ore type is  significantly less common in Proterozoic rocks. Only one  known deposit (Pering-Bushy Park) is contained in Neoar- chean rocks.\"\n\"Perspectives of this debate  are summarized by Snyder (1967), Brown (1970), Ohle (1970)  and Leach and others (2005). Modern thoughts on the origin of MVT deposits began  with fluid inclusion studies that showed the ore fluids were  similar to oil-field brines (Newhouse, 1933; Hall and Fried- man, 1963; Roedder and others, 1963; White, 1968). A major  step in understanding their genesis was the suggestion that  they formed by the mixing of multiple basinal fluids with  contrasting reduced sulfur and metal content (for example,  Dunham, 1966). Early models assumed that MVT deposits  had no connection with tectonic processes. However, in the  last 25-30 years, studies have noted the association of MVT\"\n\"6  A Deposit Model for Mississippi Valley-Type Lead-Zinc Ores ore genesis to major crustal tectonic events (see Sharp, 1978;  Garven, 1985; Oliver, 1986; Leach and Rowan 1986; Bethke  and Marshak, 1990; Oliver, 1992; Leach and others, 2001).  Furthermore, in the last 20 years, abundant evidence has  shown that the ore fluids were derived mainly from evaporated  seawater and were driven within platform carbonates by large- scale tectonic events.  Perhaps the most significant achieve- ments in understanding MVT ore genesis have been from  advances in dating MVT ores (for example, Leach and others,  2001, and references therein).  Regional Environment Geotectonic Environment It is generally recognized that most MVT deposits have  a temporal and spatial connection with orogenic forelands  (Garven, 1985; Mitchell, 1985; Leach and Rowan, 1986;  Oliver, 1986; Leach and others, 2001).\"\n\"2).  Recent papers on the secu- lar distribution of MVT ores include Leach and others (2001;  2005; 2010) and Kesler and Reich (2006). Leach and others  (2005; 2010) attribute the distribution to the increased recy- cling rate of carbonate rocks in passive margin environments  and to a fundamental change in the nature and permeability  of carbonate platform sequences beginning in the Neopro- terozoic. Ancient carbonate platforms consisted primarily  of stromatolites and sea-floor precipitates (Grotzinger and  James, 2000). Synsedimentary lithification, early diagenetic  dolomitization and silicification, lack of bioturbation, and  coarse skeletal carbonate debris, render these platform car- bonate successions impermeable (Grotzinger, 1989). Kesler  and Reich (2006) and Leach and others (2010) suggested the  lower contents of sulfate in Proterozoic seawater limited the  production of oxidized evaporites that favor formation of  MVT ores.\"\n\"Kesler  and Reich (2006) and Leach and others (2010) suggested the  lower contents of sulfate in Proterozoic seawater limited the  production of oxidized evaporites that favor formation of  MVT ores.  However, Leach and others (2010) show that the  genesis of MVT ores and the formation of most evaporites in  the rock record are not coeval, suggesting that MVT ore fluids  are sourced from preexisting brines in the carbonate platform  sequences.  Duration of Magmatic-Hydrothermal System  and/or Mineralizing Processes The few studies that focused on the duration of MVT  mineralizing events indicate the ore forming event was  relatively short compared to the duration of the associated  orogenic events. Rowan and Goldhaber (1995) used fluid  inclusion data together with thermal alteration of biomarkers to  calculate the duration of the ore-forming event in the Upper  Mississippi Valley district.\"\n\"the ferric iron  then oxidizes more pyrite or marcasite releasing more acid  (Moses and others, 1987):          FeS2 + 14 Fe3+ + 8 H2O  =  15 Fe2+ + 2 SO4 2- + 16 H+     (2)                    The sulfuric acid produced by the oxidation of iron  sulfides attacks other sulfide minerals and country rocks in  the deposit or waste material, releasing Zn, Pb, and their trace  elements (TEs) into solution. The reaction rates for weathering  and dissolution of marcasite are greater than those for pyrite.  Trace elements contained in sulfides from various MVT dis- tricts are shown in table 3.  Rates of Reactions and Factors Controlling The rate of formation of sulfuric acid depends on a number  of factors.\"\n\"The Pb and Zn content of these  brines can reach several hundred parts per million and there  is a pronounced inverse relation with reduced sulfur content.  Recent calculations of Zn in sphalerite fluid inclusions are  reported to be as great as 3,000 to 5,000 parts per million  (ppm) (Wilkinson and others, 2009). Stable Isotope Geochemistry Sulfur Isotopes Sulfur isotope values of MVT sulfides throughout the  world are consistent with sulfur being derived from a variety  of crustal sources (Sangster, 1990), that may include sulfate- bearing evaporites, connate seawater, diagenetic sulfides,  sulfur-bearing organic material and H2S reservoir gas. The  ultimate source of the sulfur is most likely seawater sulfate  contained by the sediments in various minerals and/or connate  water that was subsequently reduced by one or more pro- cesses (Sangster, 1968; 1971; 1990).\"\n\"The  ultimate source of the sulfur is most likely seawater sulfate  contained by the sediments in various minerals and/or connate  water that was subsequently reduced by one or more pro- cesses (Sangster, 1968; 1971; 1990). The \u03b434S values for MVT  sphalerite and galena are typically less than those for seawater  contemporaneous in age with the host rocks (Sangster, 1968;  1971; 1990). The \u03b434S values for many districts reflect mix- ing of sulfur from different sources, isotopic fractionation as  a function of mineralogy, disequilibrium and kinetic effects  between mineral pairs, and chemical environment. Given  the complexities possible for sulfur isotope fractionation,  extreme variations in the \u03b434S values (fig. 11) are expected.  Despite the variability of the data, some general observations  are warranted.\"\n\"Given  the complexities possible for sulfur isotope fractionation,  extreme variations in the \u03b434S values (fig. 11) are expected.  Despite the variability of the data, some general observations  are warranted. Biogenic sulfate reduction (BSR) is commonly  invoked to explain the wide range in \u03b434S values in MVT  deposits and is the best explanation for the extreme negative  values of \u03b434S observed in some deposits.  Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes Gangue carbonate minerals generally have distinct oxy- gen and carbon isotopes (lighter) when compared with MVT  host rocks, indicative of infiltration of an external hydrother- mal fluid during mineralization.  At the Pine Point deposit, and  applicable worldwide, Qing and Mountjoy (1994) noted that  the oxygen isotopes indicated a higher temperature than would  occur from geothermal heating from burial, so an external  hydrothermal fluid invading the area is required to create the  oxygen isotope signature.\"\n\"Geochemical Characteristics  23 elucidation of the processes for sulfide mineralization and the  source for reduced sulfur has commonly referred to carbon  isotopes, unfortunately with mixed interpretations.  The great  depletion of 13C found in the gangue dolomites of Nanisivik,  Canada has been interpreted to be due to thermochemical  sulfate reduction releasing isotopically light CO2 from organic  matter (Ghazban and others, 1991), as organic matter is  commonly associated with MVT deposits.  However, Savard  and others (2000) prefer fluid mixing between metal-bearing  and reduced sulfur-bearing fluids at the site of deposition at  Polaris, Canada, because gangue carbonates have \u03b413C values  similar to those of the host rocks.   Radiogenic Isotope Geochemistry Strontium Isotopes Gangue dolomite has consistently more radiogenic  strontium (higher 87Sr/86Sr) than host dolostones and unaltered  carbonates that were derived from seawater.\"\n\"This change in  strontium values is thought to occur by increasing dilution  from formation waters, mixing with some other fluid, or  increased interaction with a cool, nonradiogenic limestone.   Lead Isotopes Leach and others (2005) provided a compilation of lead  isotope data from global sediment-hosted Pb-Zn deposits  (MVT and SEDEX) to provide insights into the possible  sources of the metal and if the data could serve to distinguish  between the two ore types. The following is a summary of  their study. A basement source or sedimentary rocks derived  from the basement is indicated for many MVT districts or  deposits. Lead isotope data for Bushy Park deposit, Pering  deposit, Gays River deposit, Walton deposit, Irish Midlands  district, Lennard Shelf district, Upper Mississippi Valley  district, Southeast Missouri district, and Tri-State district have  all been interpreted in terms of a significant component from  basement-derived lead.\"\n\"Other observations include:   1.    Pb appears to have been ultimately derived from crustal  sources, in accord with their close association with sedi- mentary basins; 2.    MVT deposits in the Midcontinent region of the United  States contain very high abundances of radiogenic Pb,  whereas no SEDEX deposits analyzed to date reveal such  abundant radiogenic Pb;  3.    model-Pb ages in SEDEX deposits are generally older  than the ages of their host rocks. Mississippi Valley-Type  model ages, in contrast, show little or no correlation with  mineralization-age determinations; some MVT deposits  yield future model ages while others show model ages  significantly older than the host rocks Petrology of Associated Igneous Rocks Igneous rocks are not genetically associated with MVT  deposits.\"\n\"The most favorable rocks and their depositional  environments are the Phanerozoic passive margin sequences  with dolomitized, carbonate platform sequences, and espe- cially those sequences that were deposited in arid belts (Leach  and others, 2010).  Petrology of Associated Metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are not genetically associated with  MVT deposits. Theory of Deposit Formation Ore Deposit System Affiliation MVT deposits formed from sedimentary brines in plat- form carbonate sequences are a sub-type of a broader class of  ores called \u201csediment-hosted Pb-Zn\u201d deposits. Sources of Metals  As discussed previously, the sources of the metals are a  variety of crustal rocks.

A conclusion from Leach and others  (2005) was that no special rock type stood out as a preferred  source. Information from Pb isotope data, discussed previ- ously in this report, suggest a variety of crustal sources for  MVT deposits that include basement rocks of various compo- sitions, the weathered regolith and basal sandstones from the  basement rocks, and carbonate aquifers. Given that reduced  sulfur content is the dominant control on the concentration  of metals in MVT ore fluids, low reduced-sulfur sedimentary  brines will have greater potential to extract metals from a variety  of lithologies. An important control on reduced sulfur content  in basin brines is the presence of chemically reactive iron that  can be sulfidized (Hunt, 1996).\"\n\"An important control on reduced sulfur content  in basin brines is the presence of chemically reactive iron that  can be sulfidized (Hunt, 1996). Rocks with high content of  reactive iron (in other words, hematitic sandstone aquifers)  may provide the means to help form metalliferous brines from  a variety of host-rock lithologies.  Sources of Sulfur  The ultimate source of the sulfur is most likely seawa- ter sulfate contained by the sediments in various minerals  and or connate water that was subsequently reduced by one  or more processes (Sangster, 1968; 1971; 1990). The imme- diate sources of sulfur for the ores include sulfate-bearing\"\n\"Theory of Deposit Formation  25 evaporites, connate seawater, diagenetic sulfides, sulfur- bearing organic material and H2S reservoir gas, and reduced  sulfur in anoxic waters of stratified basins. Sulfate in the  metalliferous fluid could be transported to the ore depositional  site and reduced locally by reductants such as organic matter.  Alternatively, the reduced sulfur could have been produced by  bacteria or other processes and later mixed with the metallifer- ous fluid.  Sources of Ligands Involved in Ore Component  Transport Although metal-bisulfide and organometallic complexes  have been proposed, only metal chloride complexes are  considered likely base metal-transporting species for MVT  ore fluids. Yardley (2005) has inferred that there is a chlorinity  threshold of \u2248>10 wt. percent in sedimentary brines for the  presence of Zn and Pb in sedimentary fluids at MVT ore form- ing conditions.\"\n\"Yardley (2005) has inferred that there is a chlorinity  threshold of \u2248>10 wt. percent in sedimentary brines for the  presence of Zn and Pb in sedimentary fluids at MVT ore form- ing conditions. In addition, there are abundant thermodynamic  calculations that show chloride complexing is the dominant  metal ligand at MVT ore forming conditions. The chlorinity  and other major solutes in the fluid inclusions of ore-stage  minerals are derived mainly from the subaerial evaporation of  seawater, and to a minor extent, from the dissolution of evapo- rate minerals (primarily halite) in the subsurface.

The evaporation may have occurred coeval with  ore-fluid migration in coastal-evaporative areas or within  closed marine basins or from residual brines stored in the  basin sedimentary sequences or the crystalline basement. As  discussed below, many ore deposits formed by the mixing of  metalliferous brines with other fluids at the depositional site.  Little is known about these \u201cother fluids\u201d. However, they  are likely fluids of various origins in the basin-sedimentary  sequence (for example, meteoric, dehydration waters from  diagenesis and metamorphism).  Chemical Transport and Transfer Processes The primary controls for the extraction, transport, and  deposition of Pb and Zn under MVT ore forming conditions  are processes related to the redox state and concentration of  sulfur species [SO4 and H2S].\"\n\"Chemical Transport and Transfer Processes The primary controls for the extraction, transport, and  deposition of Pb and Zn under MVT ore forming conditions  are processes related to the redox state and concentration of  sulfur species [SO4 and H2S]. As discussed previously, the  reduced sulfur content is the dominant control on the concen- tration of metals in MVT ore fluids, thus low reduced-sulfur  sedimentary brines will have greater potential to extract met- als from a variety of lithologies. Therefore, geological and  geochemical features that buffer the redox state of aqueous  sulfur species must be considered in resource assessments.  Most MVT ore fluids are believed to have been in equi- librium with carbonate-bearing lithologies which limits the pH  values greater than \u2248 4.5 to 5 under most MVT pressures and  temperatures. However if the fluids are in equilibrium with  crystalline rocks, lower pH can be achieved and therefore,  more reduced sulfur and higher metal contents are possible.\"\n\"\u2022 Transtensional, wrench, strike-slip, and fore bulge  normal faults are most favorable. \u2022 Evidence of evaporative facies in regional carbonates   (gypsum and salt casts).

Sulfate is commonly the major anionic  component in MVT drainage water. Smith and Schumacher  (1991) reported a maximum concentration of 850 mg/L in Old  Lead Belt mine-waste seeps. Wirt and others (2001) reported  up to 11,000 mg/L sulfate, with a median of 360 mg/L from  Upper Silesia district mine seeps. There are several possible reasons for the higher metal  and sulfate concentrations in the high-Fe-sulfide deposit seeps.  First, the pyrite itself can contain high concentrations of trace  elements such as As, Co, Ni, or Tl. In addition, the higher  pyrite content generates greater amounts of sulfuric acid, and  local low-pH conditions at mineral surfaces dissolve greater  quantities of the primary sulfides and their contained trace  elements.\"\n\nSummarize the paragraphs above into a list of mappable proxies that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0, "metadata": {"component": "source"}}

Only one  known deposit (Pering-Bushy Park) is contained in Neoar- chean rocks.\"\n\"This relation applies to most  MVT districts, including the Ozark MVT province (for  example, Clendenin and Duane, 1990). Bradley and Leach  (2003) discussed MVT deposits that formed within extensional  domains that developed due to lithospheric flexure (refer to  figures 2, 3, 11 and 12, in Bradley and Leach, 2003) or in  large dilational zones within bounding strike-slip faults during  large-scale contractional events. Ordovician normal faults  related to the Taconic collision controlled MVT mineralization  in the Newfoundland Zinc district (Bradley, 1993). Far-field  tectonic effects in the host rocks for MVT deposits commonly  reflect reactivation of preexisting faults and fractures in the  basement (for example, Ozark Province, Irish Midlands, and  C\u00e8vennes).\"\n\"Far-field  tectonic effects in the host rocks for MVT deposits commonly  reflect reactivation of preexisting faults and fractures in the  basement (for example, Ozark Province, Irish Midlands, and  C\u00e8vennes). Far-field extension inboard of orogenic belts can  extend several hundred kilometers into the foreland and may  explain districts such as those in the Western Canada Basin,  Upper Mississippi Valley, and the Irish Midlands. The endow- ment of orogenic forelands with MVT deposits reflects the  link between contractional events in orogenic zones, inboard  extensional tectonic domains, and fluid flow. The extensional  domains provide fluid drains for large regional aquifers (in  other words, like the Ozark region) or focused pathways for  the ascent of fluids in buoyancy-driven hydrothermal systems. Relations to Igneous Rocks Igneous rocks are not genetically associated with MVT  deposits.\"\n\"Relations to Igneous Rocks Igneous rocks are not genetically associated with MVT  deposits. Relations to Sedimentary Rocks Obviously MVT ores are related to carbonate rocks  simply by definition of the ore type. However, the most  fundamental control on where MVT ores are deposited is  determined by lithology transitions, especially those which  create dramatic changes in both the vertical and lateral perme- ability of the rocks in a carbonate platform sequences. The  ore controls in figure 3 are mainly controls on the transmis- sivity of the ore-forming fluids which include facies transition  (shale to carbonate, limestone to dolostone, and sandstone to  carbonates), and the dramatic facies transitions common in  reef and barrier complexes. Pre-ore dissolution collapse fea- tures are important ore controls in most MVT districts because  they can provide extreme contrasting fluid transmissivity in  carbonate platform sequences.\"\n\"These individual ore breccias  total 60 deposits in a 1,600 km2 district. 2. Some MVT districts appear as an interconnected paleo- karst network that may extend for many kilometers.  For  example, the East Tennessee ore field connects multiple  districts over a 15,000 km2 area (Kesler and others, 1988).   3. MVT districts with mineralization controlled by carbonate  reef and barrier facies such as the Southeast Missouri Dis- trict which have plan views reflective of the reef complex  (fig. 4) (Ohle, 1996; Leach and others, 2005). Economic,  sub-economic, and trace mineralization define a nearly  continuous belt that extends for more than 160 km. 4. MVT deposits that have a dominant fault control (for  example, Raibl, Italy, and Irish Midlands) have plan views  that trend along the strike projection of the ore control- ling fault system (fig. 5) (see Hitzman and Beaty, 1996 in  Leach and others, 2005).\"\n\"More MVT deposits are hosted in dolostone rather than  limestone, and dolostone-hosted deposits are generally larger  and contain higher Pb, Zn, and Ag grades than those in other  host rocks (Leach and others, 2005). The preference for miner- alization to be hosted by dolostone may be related to a higher  transmissivity to fluid flow compared to limestone. An excep- tion to this tendency is the large and high-grade Navan deposit  in the Irish Midlands district that is hosted by limestone.  Structural Setting(s) and Controls Faults and fractures are important ore controls in most  MVT districts (fig. 3).  The faults are usually unmineralized;  rather, ore is localized in dilatancy zones associated with the  faults. Ores located in dilatancy zones of normal faults include  the deposits in the Irish Midlands district (fig.\"\n\"12  A Deposit Model for Mississippi Valley-Type Lead-Zinc Ores and Beaty, 1996; Hitzman, 1999; Leach and others, 2005) and  Upper Silesia district (Kibitlewski, 1991). Mineralization is  localized in dilatancy zones associated with wrench faulting in  the Viburnum Trend district (Clendenin, 1993; Clendenin and  others, 1994). Transtensional faults are important in the Ozark  MVT province (Hudson, 2000) and dilatancy zones between  strike-slip faults are important ore controls in the C\u00e9vennes  district. In some deposits, normal faults have juxtaposed  different rock units, which provide for the focused ascent of  metalliferous fluids into contrasting geochemical environ- ments and sites of fluid mixing (Reocin, Spain; Upper Silesia,  Poland; Toussit-Bou Becker, Morocco; and Irish Midlands,  Ireland).\"\n\"Use of Geophysics in Resource  Assessment for Mississippi Valley- Type Deposits A composite, multi-scale geophysical approach can assist  in the assessment of the potential for Mississippi Valley-Type  (MVT) deposits.  Regional gravity and magnetic data, particu- larly when interpreted with drilling and/or seismic constraints,  are useful for mapping basement depth and composition.   These data also are useful for delineating subsurface fault  zones that may have provided pathways for ore fluids.  For the conterminous United States, regional-scale grav- ity, magnetic, and gamma-ray data are available for use in  MVT assessment.  Published regional scale interpretations  (for example, Simpson and others, 1986 for gravity; Sims  and others, 2008 for magnetic) provide good starting points  for more specific interpretation relating to revised assessment  study.  On going work by Mickus and students (for example,  Cosatt and Mickus, 2008) is focused on regional geophysical  characterization of the historical MVT districts in the central  United States.\"\n\"For example,  Siegel and others (1968) describe a combined IP/gravity  TERTIARY Sandstone, Shales, and Limestone Marls UPPER CRETACEOUS LOWER CRETACEOUS Turonian Limestone Albian Marls and Marly Limestone Cenomanian Marls PERIOD Sandstone and Marles F1 F2 F3 SALT DOME (TRIASSIC EVAPORITES) Anhydrite, Halite, Shales, Dolostone, and Sandstone Arrows indicate fluid flow direction F1 F2 F3 high-grade, semi-massive ore stratabound disseminated ore Not to Scale small lenticular, strata-, or fault-controlled ore bodies  BAHLOUL FORMATION Black Shales and  Laminae Limestone Figure 7. Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) deposit in Tunisia displaying the relation between MVT mineralization and a salt dome  environment (modified from Leach and others, 2005).\"\n\"Perhaps the  best-developed zoning is for some deposits in the Irish Mid- lands district, where metal-bearing fluids were highly focused  into limestone by steeply dipping basement-rooted faults.  In  the Irish Midlands district, the Navan deposit displays a verti- cal increase in Fe and Zn/Pb from the center of the deposit  along with a lateral increase in Zn/Pb outward, while other  Irish deposits display Pb-enrichment near the feeder zones  with increasing Zn/Pb away from the feeder zones (Hitzman  and Large, 1986).  Deposits in the Southeast Missouri districts  have chemical zoning patterns of Pb, Zn, Fe, Cu, Ni, and Co;  however, these patterns are highly irregular along the trend of  deposits (for example, Hagni, 1983; Mavrogenes and others,  1992, and references therein).\"\n\"Calcite is common in a few MVT districts (for example, Central  Tennessee) and is more likely to be present in limestone- dominated lithologies (for example, Irish Midlands). Dolomite  commonly forms intricate and complex compositional zoning,  (see Rowan, 1986) which can provide constraints on MVT ore  fluid pathways.  Quartz is present in most MVT deposits in generally  minor to trace amounts depending on the relative importance  of cooling and dilution of the ore fluid (Plumlee and others,  1994; Leach and others, 2006). Extensive silicification of the  host-carbonate rocks is present in the Tri-State district, Northern  Arkansas and Metaline district where silica forms alteration  zones about the ores. Coarse quartz crystals also occur on ore  minerals in places like the Viburnum Trend.   Barite occurs in minor to trace amounts in some ore  deposits where it is generally late in the paragenetic sequence.\"\n\"Hydrothermal Alteration Dissolution and Hydrothermal Brecciation The most common host-rock modification associated with  MVT deposits is dissolution and hydrothermal brecciation of  the carbonate-host rocks that result from reactions of the ore  fluid (Corbella and others, 2004) with the host-rocks or from  acid-producing reactions commonly associated with fluid mix- ing (Anderson, 1983). Consequently, hydrothermal dissolu- tion features and replacement halos are common in and about  MVT deposits. The most significant acid production occurs as  a consequence of the mixing of reduced sulfur-bearing fluids  with a metal-bearing fluid and, to a lesser extent, by sulfate  reduction in the ore zone. Dolomite and Calcite Alteration Dolomite or calcite alteration of the host-rocks is present  in most MVT deposits. As discussed above, carbonate flood- ing of porosity about the deposits often forms envelopes that  extend for meters to hundreds of meters.\"\n\"8). These ranges are similar to  values determined by Basuki and Spooner (2004). The highest  fluid inclusion temperatures (~180\u00b0C to ~ 250\u00b0C) recorded  are for the Irish Midlands district and Gays River deposit, ores  that were relatively near each other during ore deposition but  drifted apart during the opening of the Atlantic (Leach and  others, 2001). In many districts (for example, the deposits in  the Ozarks region in the Midcontinent United States, Irish  Midlands, Upper Silesia, and C\u00e8vennes districts), the fluid  inclusion temperatures generally exceed values expected  for geologically reasonable thermal gradients and estimated  stratigraphic burial temperatures at the time of mineralization.  Therefore, the temperatures observed for many ore deposits  must be explained by unusually high geothermal gradients,  advective heat transport from deeper parts of the basin (as with  the Ozark MVT province), or the ascent of deeply circulating  fluids in basement rocks beneath the deposits (for example,  Upper Silesia and Irish Midlands).\"\n\"This uniquely  radiogenic strontium signature indicates that the responsible  fluid interacted and flowed through rocks containing potassium- rich minerals such as potassium feldspar, muscovite, and  clays.  For individual deposits, this can be used to trace which  sedimentary or metamorphic formation had interacting fluids  that transported this signature to the site of ore deposition.   Systematic decreases in 87Sr/86Sr have been linked to  fluid-flow direction (Hitzman and others, 1998; Paradis  and others, 2006).  Lower 87Sr/86Sr typically accompanies  increasing \u03b418O down fluid-flow gradient.  This change in  strontium values is thought to occur by increasing dilution  from formation waters, mixing with some other fluid, or  increased interaction with a cool, nonradiogenic limestone.\"\n\"Increases in fracture den- sity, especially in dolostones may contribute to the explora- tion for deposits within districts where faults and fractures are  important controls.   Secondary Porosity Dissolution of the host carbonates is an expected conse- quence of sulfide deposition. Therefore, increased secondary  porosity may indicate proximity to ore depositional sites. Hydrothermal Cement As discussed in previous sections, hydrothermal calcite  or dolomite may form halos around deposits or in some cases  may be expressed as regional alterations of the aquifers for  brine migration. Techniques such as cathodoluminescence  (CL) or microstratigraphy (for example, Rowan, 1986)  can delineate possible fluid pathways and small changes in  the redox state of the ore fluid that control the intensity of  cathodoluminescence.  Organic Matter Increased abundance of organic matter in carbonate rocks  or thermally altered organic matter may signal the effects of  the passage of hot sedimentary brines.\"\n\"However if the fluids are in equilibrium with  crystalline rocks, lower pH can be achieved and therefore,  more reduced sulfur and higher metal contents are possible. In  this case, sedimentary brines in crystalline basement rocks that  ascend into carbonate cover rocks, can precipitate metal in suf- ficient quantities through cooling and change in pH. Fluid-Drive Mechanisms The fluid-drive mechanisms proposed for MVT depos- its are numerous and include topography-driven, sediment  compaction, orogenic squeezing, overpressured gas reservoirs,  and thermal and density reflux drives. Leach and others (2001)  considered the implications of fluid flow mechanisms from  the perspective of the ages of MVT ore formation and con- cluded that no single mechanism can be applied to all districts.  However, the most robust mechanism for many MVT districts  is topography-driven fluid flow. Support for this comes from  the ages of MVT ore genesis that often coincide with the time  of orogenesis of adjacent uplifted margins of foreland and  intracratonic basins.\"\n\"Support for this comes from  the ages of MVT ore genesis that often coincide with the time  of orogenesis of adjacent uplifted margins of foreland and  intracratonic basins. Furthermore, Garven and Raffensperger  (1997) and Garven and others (1999) support that the flow   patterns, rates of flow, and thermal effects generated by   topography-driven hydrologic systems seem to provide opti- mal conditions for ore genesis, conditions that are not simu- lated in models of other fluid-flow processes, such as basin  subsidence and compaction. Nature of Traps and Geological Controls that  Trigger Ore Precipitation The ore controls recognized for selected MVT dis- tricts are shown in figure 3. The ore controls can be viewed  as fundamental factors in fluid transmissivity, either at the  district or mine scale, that allow the focusing of fluid flow  and create opportunities for depositional processes to occur.\"\n\"26  A Deposit Model for Mississippi Valley-Type Lead-Zinc Ores Dissolution-Collapse Breccias Dissolution collapse breccia is the most common host  for MVT ores. Dissolution-collapse breccias are typically  complex multistage breccias consisting of ore-stage hydro- thermal dissolution with selective replacement textures that  are superimposed on pre-ore breccias. The complex interplay  between sulfide deposition, acid generation, and hydrothermal  brecciation with pre-ore carbonate dissolution features is  discussed by Leach and others (2003). In nearly all MVT  districts, preexisting solution-collapse breccias and related  carbonate-dissolution features provide high permeability  zones that facilitate effective fluid mixing and ore deposi- tion. These may be pre-ore solution-collapse features that are  commonly located beneath an unconformity or disconformity,  suggesting they originated by subaerial karstification.\"\n\"Nevertheless, the  distinction between meteoric and hydrothermal karst is usually  problematic. The lack of speleothems and other cave features  in MVT ore breccias is commonly argued for hydrothermal  dissolution brecciation. In reality, the absence of these features  could reflect their destruction by mineralization or a pre-ore  hydrothermal (non-sulfide occurence) in a preexisting meteoric  karst.  If the pre-ore karst breccia network (sulfide barren) is  regionally extensive from the ore-bearing breccias or related  to a regional unconformity, a meteoric origin is likely (like the  East Tennessee district).  Faults and Fractures Faults and fractures are important controls in most MVT  districts. The faults are usually unmineralized; rather, ore is  localized in dilatancy zones associated with the faults.\"\n\"Faults and Fractures Faults and fractures are important controls in most MVT  districts. The faults are usually unmineralized; rather, ore is  localized in dilatancy zones associated with the faults. Ores  located in dilatancy zones of normal faults include the deposits  in the Irish Midlands district (for example, Hitzman, 1999)  and Upper Silesia district (Kibitlewski, 1991). Mineralization  is localized in dilatancy zones associated with wrench faulting  in the Viburnum Trend district (Clendenin, 1993; Clendenin  and others, 1994). Transtensional faults are important in the  Ozark MVT province (Hudson, 2000) and dilatancy zones  between strike-slip faults are important ore controls in the  C\u00e9vennes district.  Facies Transitions Shales and shaley carbonate units that act as aquitards  within a stratigraphic sequence provide an important control  on fluid migration.\"\n\"Reduced sulfur model (one fluid model)  Metals and reduced sulfur transported together in acidic fluid at temperatures \u2248>200\u00b0C  Decrease in temperature  Decrease in pressure  Change in pH  Dilution  Wall-rock alteration  Addition of reduced sulfur Local sulfate reduction model (oxidized sulfur and metal fluid + local sulfate reduction) Metals and sulfate carried in same solution to depositional site; sulfate locally reduced by reactions with methane or other organic matter Metals and sulfate reducing agent (for example, methane) carried to sulfate at depositional site Two fluid mixing model: metal-bearing fluid mixes with reduced sulfur fluid (two fluid model)  Metals carried by a fluid with low content of reduced sulfur fluid; this fluid mixes with fluids with abundant reduced sulfur  Mixing of metal-rich fluid with reduced sulfur-rich fluid  Mixing of metal-rich fluid with local hydrogen sulfide gas reservoir Table 4.

The Lisheen, Irish  Midlands deposit was discovered in 1990 with the use of soil  geochemistry, geologic mapping, and geophysics (Hitzman,  1992; Hitzman and others, 1992).  Newfoundland Zinc was  discovered in 1963 by means of a regional geochemical survey  (Crossley and Lane, 1984).  In the Ozark region, Erickson and  others (1983) identified regional geochemical halos of trace  elements in insoluble residues of barren carbonate rocks that  extend for several hundred kilometers from the MVT districts.   Other MVT deposits that were discovered by means of sur- ficial geochemistry include numerous deposits in the Yukon,  Canada. Geophysics Regional gravity and magnetics can be useful in defining  basement highs and fundamental structures.\"\n\"Primary geochemical zoning of metal deposition in MVT  deposits is limited and has been described in only a few areas  (Southeast Missouri, Pine Point, and Upper Mississippi Valley  districts; Leach and others, 2005). Primary dispersion halos  are small scale; most MVT deposits have minor geochemical  signatures because of limited primary dispersion of elements  into surrounding carbonate country rock (Lavery and others,  1994). In other studies, insoluble residue analyses of soils  have been used to detect MVT mineralization (Proctor and  others, 1981). Stream sediment geochemistry and boulder  tracing studies have been successful in the discovery of MVT  deposits in Canada. In general, the geochemical signature of unmined MVT  deposits in soil and sediment media is limited in amplitude and  areal extent.\"\n\"Arsenic-bearing pyrite occurs in some MVT deposits.  When deposit material is isolated from oxygenated groundwa- ter, As does not typically release from the pyrite. However, if  the deposit has a fracture system, or waste material is porous  and permeable, atmospheric oxygen can reach the pyrite (and  other As-bearing sulfides such as sphalerite) and release As  into groundwater (Lee and Goldhaber, 2001). Released As can  become sorbed or incorporated into Fe oxides and transferred  to suspended or bottom sediment. Marcasite, which can be the  dominant sulfide, can release As in anoxic waters. However,  Lee and Goldhaber (2001) found no dissolved As concentra- tions greater than 10 \u03bcg/L in Ozark Plateau waters.\"\n\"25, no. 3, p. 12.

Carbon- ate rocks overlying fractured or faulted crystalline basement  rocks also provide a contrast in the reactivity of the ore fluids.

Salt-dome environments provide a minor  but interesting form of MVT ores. Sulfides are present in the  cap-rock mineral assemblage, as fracture fill, and as replace- ment of carbonate host rocks. The most important deposits   are the Fedj el Adoum and Bou Grine deposits in Tunisia   (fig. 7) (Rouvier and others, 1985; Leach and others, 2005).  Other significant but presently noneconomic occurrences are  in the Gulf Coast of the United States (Kyle and Saunders,  1996).\"\n\"As discussed above, carbonate flood- ing of porosity about the deposits often forms envelopes that  extend for meters to hundreds of meters. In many examples,  the hydrothermal alteration produces a coarsely crystalline  dolomite by recrystallization of the host carbonate rocks [for  example, gray coarse-grained early dolomite halos in Tri-State  district (McKnight and Fischer, 1970)]. Silicification  Silicification of the host carbonate rocks is generally  minor in most MVT deposits but is well developed in the Tri- State (Brockie and others, 1968) and the Northern Arkansas  districts (McKnight, 1935). In both districts, the hydrothermal  silicification and dolomitization form as alteration halos about  the ore zones.\"\n\"Organic Matter Increased abundance of organic matter in carbonate rocks  or thermally altered organic matter may signal the effects of  the passage of hot sedimentary brines. Facies Transition Facies transitions discussed previously are extremely  important controls (for example, back reef to fore reef,  limestone to dolomite, micrites to calcarenite). Therefore,  fundamental carbonate facies studies can assist delineation of  permissive areas for MVT mineralization.  Environment of Deposition MVT ores are found in a variety of carbonate facies.  However, the least favorable carbonates and their environ- ments include the massive micritic and fine-grained deep- water carbonates, shaley back reef facies, chemical precipi- tates, and Archean to early Neoproterozoic carbonate platform  sequences.\"\n\"Facies Transitions Shales and shaley carbonate units that act as aquitards  within a stratigraphic sequence provide an important control  on fluid migration. The relation between a shale edge and loca- tion of MVT deposits in the Tri-State district is shown by the  occurrence of ore only beyond the subcrop edge of the Chat- tanooga and Northview shales, both of which stratigraphically  underlie the main ore-bearing carbonate units in the district  (Siebenthal, 1916; Brockie and others, 1968). In the Viburnum  Trend, ore deposits are restricted to a diagenetic dolostone  located within a few kilometers of a facies transition to shaley  limestone.

Quartz is present in most MVT deposits in generally  minor to trace amounts depending on the relative importance  of cooling and dilution of the ore fluid (Plumlee and others,  1994; Leach and others, 2006). Extensive silicification of the  host-carbonate rocks is present in the Tri-State district, Northern  Arkansas and Metaline district where silica forms alteration  zones about the ores.
