Introduction  Overview Magmatic sulfide deposits containing nickel (Ni) and   copper (Cu), with or without (\u00b1) platinum-group elements  (PGE), account for approximately 60 percent of the world\u2019s  nickel production (Naldrett, 2004). Most of the remainder of   the Ni production is derived from lateritic deposits, which form  by weathering of ultramafic rocks in humid tropical conditions  (Elias, 2002; Freyssinet and others, 2005). Magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide deposits are spatially and genetically related to bodies of  mafic and/or ultramafic rocks. The sulfide deposits form when  the mantle-derived mafic and/or ultramafic magmas become  sulfide-saturated and segregate immiscible sulfide liquid,  commonly following interaction with continental crustal rocks  (Arndt and others, 2005). Deposits of magmatic Ni-Cu sulfides occur with mafic and/ or ultramafic bodies emplaced in diverse geologic settings.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

They  range in age from Archean to Tertiary, but the largest number  of deposits are Archean and Paleoproterozoic (Eckstrand and  Hulbert, 2007). Although deposits occur on most continents, ore  deposits (deposits of sufficient size and grade to be economic to  mine) are relatively rare; major deposits are present in Russia,  China, Australia, Canada, and southern Africa (fig. 1\u20131). Nickel- Cu sulfide ore deposits can occur as single or multiple sulfide  lenses within mafic and/or ultramafic bodies with clusters of  such deposits comprising a district or mining camp. Typically,  deposits contain ore grades of between 0.5 and 3 percent Ni  and between 0.2 and 2 percent Cu (Eckstrand and Hulbert,  2007).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The sulfide  deposits and their host intrusions range in age from Archean  to at least Middle Jurassic. They generally are found close to  deeply penetrating faults that allow for the efficient transport  of sulfur-undersaturated magma from the mantle to relatively  shallow crustal depths.

Deposits are hosted  by a wide range of typically olivine-bearing mantle-derived  rocks related to ferropicrite (Pechenga), tholeiitic picrite  (Noril\u2019sk-Talnakh), and high-aluminum basalt (Voisey\u2019s Bay).  No known economic deposits are associated with mid-ocean  ridge basalts (MORB), ophiolites, or alkaline rocks. The principal sulfide minerals in most sulfide-rich  Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits consist of intergrown pyrrhotite, pent- landite, and chalcopyrite. Cobalt (Co) is found in pentlandite,  and PGE generally appear as small grains of PGE-bearing  sulfides, arsenides, antimonides, bismithides, and tellurides.  Deposits also locally contain 1 to 15 percent magnetite  (Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The largest concentrations of  sulfide minerals tend to occur either at the base of the host  intrusion or in the immediate footwall. The sulfides generally  are present as disseminated, matrix or net, and massive sulfide,  based on a combination of the sulfide content and silicate  texture of the rock. In most cases the massive and matrix ore  is zoned, with Cu-rich zones relatively enriched in gold (Au),  palladium (Pd), and platinum (Pt). Those zones, as footwall  dikes and veins, either overlie or are separated from Cu-poor  zones relatively enriched in osmium (Os), iridium (Ir), ruthe- nium (Ru), and rhodium (Rh). The compositional zonation is  attributed to fractionation of monosulfide solid solution (MSS)  from a sulfide liquid (Naldrett, 2004).

Historical Evolution of Descriptive and Genetic Knowledge and Concepts   7 3. Historical Evolution of Descriptive  and Genetic Knowledge and Concepts  The history of understanding of magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide deposits has been reviewed most recently by Papunen  (1991) and Naldrett (2005) and is briefly summarized here.  Unlike other commodities such as iron and copper, which have  long been known and extracted, the element Ni was only first  identified in 1751 by the Swedish chemist Cronstedt, who  separated the new metal from cobalt ores from the Los mine in  Sweden (Howard-White, 1963). The earliest mining of Ni did  not begin until 1848, shortly after a new Fe-Ni sulfide mineral,  pentlandite, was discovered at the old Espendalen copper mine  in Norway (Boyd and Nixon, 1985).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Nickel production from  the Espendalen deposit was soon followed by the discovery  and mining of several other sulfide deposits in southern   Norway, and by 1876, Norwegian production peaked at   360 metric tons (t) per year (Howard-White, 1963).

Concepts of the origin of magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sul- fide deposits have been influenced strongly by studies of the  Sudbury deposits (fig. 3\u20131). These concepts fall mostly into  two opposing interpretations, one emphasizing a magmatic  origin and the other a hydrothermal origin. As early as 1891,  Bell (1891a) proposed that the Sudbury ores were the result  of the separation and settling of a dense sulfide liquid during  differentiation of the magma that gave rise to the Sudbury  Igneous Complex (SIC). This conclusion was supported by  Barlow (1906), who recognized (1) two principal units in  the SIC, a lower noritic layer and an overlying granophyric  layer; and (2) the occurrence of the ore bodies in embayments  along the lower contact of the norite.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Further, he argued that the restriction of the  sulfide deposits to the outer (that is, lower) contact of the SIC,  the intimate mixture of sulfide and norite in all proportions,  the lack of hydrothermal alteration, and the occurrence of the  largest concentrations of sulfides in embayments along the  footwall contact strongly supported the gravitationally induced  settling of sulfide liquid from the SIC magma.

A subsequent extensive microscopic  study of the Sudbury ores by Wandke and Hoffman (1924)   also led them to conclude that the deposits were hydrothermal  in origin.  As noted by Naldrett (2005), arguments about the mag- matic versus hydrothermal origin of the Sudbury ores persisted  through most of the first half of the twentieth century, with  those mapping and studying the SIC favoring a magmatic  origin and those most familiar with the mines favoring a hydro- thermal origin.

Since Hawley\u2019s work, the magmatic origin of the  Sudbury Ni-Cu sulfide deposits has been generally accepted,  although a hydrothermal origin for some footwall Cu- and  PGE-enriched deposits is still debated (Naldrett, 2004, 2005). General acceptance of a magmatic origin for Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide ores at Sudbury led to the model that magmatic sulfide  ore bodies form along the base of large, layered mafic intru- sions owing to gravitational settling of a dense sulfide liquid  segregated from the parental magmas upon emplacement.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The apparent lack of success in the discovery of major  Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits using the Sudbury model is now  generally attributed to the ore-forming processes at Sudbury  having been in a large part unique.

However, because the amount of intrusive and underplated  rock is difficult to estimate but probably equals or exceeds  the volcanic component, size estimates for LIPs are minimum  values.

Recognition of LIPs in the Archean is uncertain  because most volcanic rocks and associated intrusions occur  in deformed and fault-segmented greenstone belts (de Wit and  Ashwal, 1997) and generally cannot be traced over LIP-scale  extents. Some greenstone belts, however, consist of tholeiite  and komatiite volcanic rock sequences that may be remnants  of Archean LIPs originally formed as oceanic plateaus or on  continental platforms (Ernst, 2007). Continental LIPs characteristically are associated with  the breakup or attempted breakup of continents (Condie, 2001;  Ernst, 2007; Begg and others, 2010). As a result, pre-Mesozoic  LIPs may be intensely fragmented by continental breakup,  with parts of a single LIP being dispersed on different crustal  blocks. This fragmentation and dispersal, as well as erosion  removing some or all of the flood basalt cover, can result in  magmatic units too small in size and volume to qualify as a  LIP.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The apparent  restriction of economic sulfide-rich Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits to  Jurassic and older magmatic systems probably is a reflection of  the more deeply eroded nature of older LIPs, thereby exposing  more of the plumbing system below extensive and barren flood  basalt sections. Currently, there are too few known deposits to  determine if there is any significant secular variation in their  occurrence (Naldrett, 2010). Studies of LIPs through time  suggest, however, that there are few significant gaps in the  post-2.6-Ga record, with an emplacement rate of about one LIP  every 20 million years (Ernst, 2007).

However, from studies of mafic magma  systems, and thermal modeling of emplacement and cooling of  intrusions, it appears that magma residence in mafic systems  is approximately a few thousand years at most and generally  only years to hundreds of years (Reid, 2003).

The  largest sulfide deposits typically are concentrated along the  base of the intrusions in locations where changes in footwall  geometry affected magma flow dynamics (Barnes and Light- foot, 2005). Relations to Sedimentary Rocks Country rocks, including basement metamorphic rocks  and upper crustal sedimentary rocks, play two important  roles in the formation of these deposits. First, crustal struc- ture helps control the formation of magma chambers, defin- ing sites where ascending magmas can be trapped at density  discontinuities in the crust (Arndt, 2005). When ascending  magma reaches horizontally bedded sedimentary strata,  magma can spread out along bedding planes, and horizontal  intrusions or sills typically form. If magma intrudes along  successively higher bedding planes, a series of upward- stepping sills will form complexes of stacked, saucer-shaped  intrusions (Chevallier and Woodford, 1999).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Second, a  common trigger for sulfur saturation and segregation of an  immiscible sulfide liquid is interaction between the sulfur- undersaturated magma and crustal rocks, which may be  sulfur-bearing. This interaction can change the temperature  and composition of the magma by incorporation of country  rock, which may decrease the sulfur solubility of the magma,  and/or add sulfur to the magma; either process potentially  can result in sulfur saturation in the magma. Horizontal  flow through upper crustal dike-sill complexes can augment  the period of interaction between magma and wall-rocks,  thereby increasing the extent of contamination (Arndt, 2005).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Relations to Metamorphic Rocks Although metamorphism does not contribute directly to the  formation of magmatic sulfide-rich Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits,  metamorphism can manifest with deposits in several ways.

In addition, meta- morphism can result in significant upgrading of the tenor of  disseminated sulfide minerals if olivine is destroyed, thereby  releasing Ni that will be taken up by sulfides. Also, sulfides  may be recrystallized, resulting in coarser sulfide textures  that can make the mineralization more amenable to mineral  processing.

That zonation of sulfides  is attributed to in situ fractionation of the original sulfide liquid  (Naldrett, 2004). In contrast to massive ores, breccia ores generally form  semi-conformable, sheet-like zones along both the lower and  upper contacts of the intrusions and may enclose massive   ore (Voisey\u2019s Bay). The breccias comprise fragments of both  the intrusion and wallrocks in a matrix mainly of massive  sulfide. Sulfide stringers and disseminations may accompany  the breccias. Disseminated sulfides (about 1 to 33 percent sulfides)  form lenticular to tabular layers generally within the middle  and lower parts of intrusions (fig. 5\u20131). In most cases, they  occur as irregular 1-mm- to 1-cm-diameter patches interstitial  to silicate and oxide minerals.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

However, a direct connection to major faults is less evident at  some other deposits, such as Voisey\u2019s Bay. 6. Geophysical Signatures  Introduction Magmatic sulfide-rich Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits, generally  hosted by relatively small picrite or tholeiitic basalt dike-sill  complexes, present some unique challenges to geophysical  exploration. Because these types of deposits involve some  combination of pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite (Ford  and others, 2007), they typically are associated with highly  anomalous physical properties, including density, magneti- zation, electrical conductivity, electrical chargeability, and  acoustic velocity. As a result, geophysical methods can be  used effectively to detect and characterize such deposits.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Unfortunately, the mafic-ultramafic host rocks, as well as  the enclosing wall rocks, also can have a variety of anoma- lous physical properties, thereby complicating geophysical  recognition of sulfide deposits. Furthermore, the geophysi- cal signatures of the sulfide deposits, as well as of the host  intrusions, may vary widely due to a variety of geometric  and geologic factors. Thus, a geophysical method that works  effectively in one region may not work at all in another (King,  2007). Finally, Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits, as well as their  host intrusions, are small, commonly only tens or hundreds  of meters in width, and they present a \u201cneedle in a haystack\u201d  scenario for any regional-scale geophysical program.

Magnetic Signature In the magnetic method, highly precise measurements of  Earth\u2019s magnetic field are used to investigate the subsurface.  Once the acquired magnetic data have been corrected for   temporal variations and for the geomagnetic reference field  (core-derived component), the remaining anomalies reflect  upper crustal geology (fig. 6\u20131). Most magnetic anomalies  reflect variations in the quantity and physical nature of the   ferromagnetic iron oxide mineral magnetite, a common  accessory in many igneous and metamorphic rocks, and these  anomalies typically have amplitudes ranging from a few   nanoTeslas to several thousand nanoTeslas. In comparison,  Earth\u2019s background geomagnetic field for much of the United  States is approximately 55,000 nanoTeslas.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

In addition, the method  can be readily applied using aircraft for aeromagnetic survey- ing, thereby allowing large areas to be covered rapidly   and efficiently. The magnetic method is particularly well-suited for  reconnaissance-scale investigations for mafic-ultramafic   dike-sill complexes that might host Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide   deposits (Ford and others, 2007).

Bouguer anomalies typically range from less than one  milligal to several tens of milligals. In comparison, the total  gravity field of the Earth is approximately 980,000 milligals.  Similar to magnetic data, gravity anomaly data can be effec- tive for investigating the geology of the igneous and metamor- phic terranes where mineral deposits may occur.  Bouguer gravity anomalies ultimately reflect subsurface  variations in density, which in turn are related to mineral  composition and porosity. Densities of earth materials typi- cally range from about 2.00 g/cm3 for unconsolidated materi- als to about 2.95 g/cm3 for mafic igneous rocks (table 6\u20132).  Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits can have host rock densities  exceeding 3.00 g/cm3 and ore densities exceeding 4.00 g/ cm3 (table 6\u20132).

Electrical Signature Most electrical geophysical methods involve measure- ment of electrical potential at the surface, typically by using a  pair of electrodes, to investigate geology at depth. Electrical  methods are based on electrical resistivity, induced polar- ization, or spontaneous potential. Electrical resistivity and  induced polarization methods use an artificial current that is  introduced via a separate electrode pair, whereas spontaneous  potential methods rely on small, passive currents that already  exist in the subsurface. In all three approaches, standard  electrode arrays are used, and by systematically varying the  position and spacing of electrodes, the variation of electrical  properties at depth, and by inference geology, can be   investigated.

The ER methods still could be used to investigate  thickness and composition of overburden, which may have  implications for other geophysical applications (Ford and  others, 2007). Resistivity surveying over the Jinchuan deposit  showed detectable resistivity responses over some ore bodies,  although this effect can be obscured seriously by conductive  alluvium (Guo and Dentith, 1997). Induced polarization (IP) methods use the same elec- trode configurations as ER methods, and they are commonly  conducted together (Sharma, 1997). The IP effect is a charge  Figure 6\u20133.

The effect is caused by interfa- cial interactions between electrolytic groundwater and highly  conductive grains of sulfide or clay particles. The IP effect  typically is expressed as chargeability, which is based on the  decay of residual potential once the current has been shut off  (time-domain IP) or as percent frequency effect (PFE), which  is based on apparent resisitivity observed at two discrete   current frequencies (frequency-domain IP). Because the IP  effect is proportional to interactive area, disseminated sulfide  deposits are more likely to produce a pronounced IP effect  than massive sulfide deposits, although disseminated haloes  that commonly surround massive deposits can produce a   significant IP response. IP/ER surveying has been applied   with some success to the Ovoid deposit at Voisey\u2019s Bay  (Balch, 1999) and to ore bodies at the Jinchuan deposit (Guo  and Dentith, 1997), although application in the latter case  was limited in some areas by conductive overburden.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Spontaneous potential (SP) methods are based on passive  monitoring of ambient currents in the shallow subsurface. The  SP currents can be caused by changes in potentials related to  movement of ion-bearing groundwater (streaming or electro- kinetic potential), differences in ionic concentration within  groundwater (diffusion potential), or by a variety of electro- chemical reactions in the vicinity of a conductive body   (mineral or electrode potential). Most SP anomalies are several  tens to hundreds of millivolts, although anomalies as large as  1,000 millivolts can occur. The SP surveying is among the   oldest and simplest electrical methods in exploration geo- physics, but its shallow depth of penetration precludes its use  in most current mineral exploration programs, and the SP  method\u2019s primary use today is for engineering and environ- mental investigations (Sharma, 1997).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Electromagnetic (EM) Signature Electromagnetic (EM) methods are used extensively for  sulfide exploration (Ford and others, 2007). This preference  is mainly because EM methods are particularly sensitive to  the high conductivities of massive sulfide bodies and because  most methods do not require the use of electrodes, readily  accommodating airborne applications.

Regardless  of their source, magnetic field fluctuations induce currents in  subsurface conductors, and those currents produce secondary  magnetic field fluctuations that can be picked up by a receiver  coil or antenna. The EM methods span a wide spectrum of  frequencies, extending from the subhertz range for magneto- telluric investigations, up to the megahertz range for geo-radar  applications; most EM methods used in sulfide exploration,  however, operate with frequencies between 1 and 1,000 hertz.

The explora- tion in the McFaulds Lake area consequently evolved into  in-field interpretation of line EM data, with almost immediate  recommendations regarding further acquisition, such as infill  lines on interesting targets. This technology, in turn, led to a  drilling program that was largely directed by HTEM data, with  essential elimination of the expensive ground-based programs,  and to a situation where prioritization of targets was more  of a problem than detection of targets.

The igneous and   metamorphic terranes that host such deposits were generally  perceived to have structures that were too complex and  impedance contrasts that were too low to be properly imaged  by seismic methods. Consequently, most seismic studies in  such settings were generally restricted to deep-crustal refrac- tion and reflection studies that had little direct significance to  mineral deposits.

Although not focused on mineral deposits, two recent  three-dimensional seismic investigations of Cretaceous\u2013  Paleocene intrusive sill complexes in the Faroe-Shetland Basin  of the northeastern Atlantic Ocean have findings that may be  significant to sulfide assessments and exploration. Hansen and  others (2004) describe individual sills that occur as trough- or  saucer-like bodies, 2 to 8 km in diameter and with a relief of  several hundred meters. The seismic data reveal that the sills  are interconnected by a variety of junctions that yield impor- tant clues on the emplacement history of the sill complex   (fig. 6\u20138).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Three\u2013dimensional seismic imaging of a sill by  Trude and others (2004) revealed a complex of ridges along  the top of one sill that appear to indicate magma flow. These  ridges, with wavelengths of 220 to 350 meters and amplitudes  of 25 to 50 m, were likely created by viscous drag near the top  of the sill and appear to radiate from distinct feeder zones   (fig. 6\u20139). Sill geometry, as well as magma flow, is impor- tant to the development of dike- and sill-hosted Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide deposits, particularly near feeder zones.

Another seismic method that may assist in exploration for  dike- and sill-hosted Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits is vertical  seismic profiling (VSP). The VSP methods are particularly  useful for imaging steeply dipping structures (>60\u00b0) not prop- erly imaged by two- or three-dimensional reflection profiling  (Salisbury and Snyder, 2007). For example, VSP could be  used to image a vertical feeder beneath a sill. In this method, a  receiver (seismometer) is lowered to the bottom of a drill hole  and then raised in stages as shots are fired at the surface   (fig. 6\u201310). If the positions of the shots and the drill hole  geometry are precisely known, then velocities can be calcu- lated from the shot receiver distances and the geometry of  steep reflectors can be imaged through processing. Cross-hole  seismic methods are essentially a variation of VSP where one  has an array of holes.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The dominant sulfide min- erals in magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits mainly are variants of  Fe-, Cu-, and Ni-bearing sulfides, which typically are pyrrho- tite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, and, less consistently, cubanite  and troilite (table 7\u20131).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Within a district, different ore  bodies may have different mineral assemblages depending on  varying combinations of the factors listed above. For example,  in the Ovoid deposit of the Voisey\u2019s Bay district, a high metal/ sulfur ratio of the high-temperature sulfide liquid resulted in  formation of abundant cubanite, rather than chalcopyrite, and  troilite, rather than pyrrhotite. In contrast, at the Eastern Deeps  deposit, cubanite is rare and troilite is absent, implying that  the sulfide liquid had a much lower metal/sulfur ratio (Naldrett  and others, 2000). Similar variations in primary sulfide min- eralogy are observed among the different deposits at Noril\u2019sk  (Naldrett, 2004).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The occurrence of platinum group minerals (PGMs)  in magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits is of critical economic  interest as PGE, typically present only in trace amounts, may  ultimately make a Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposit economically viable.  Noril\u2019sk stands out among other major magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide deposits because of exceptionally high concentrations  of PGE, possibly due to upgrading by influxes of new magma  interacting with pre-existing sulfides (Naldrett, 2004). How- ever, there are differences in PGE contents among Noril\u2019sk  deposits. Sulfides from the Talnakh area are one order of mag- nitude richer in PGE than sulfides from the Oktyabr\u2019sky area  (Barnes and others, 1997). At Noril\u2019sk the majority of PGMs  occur as coexisting minerals in disseminated ore, rather than  in massive ore (Distler, 1994).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

In the  absence of these semimetals, Pt and Pd will enter the lattice of  high-temperature sulfides and subsequently exsolve as lamel- lae in pentlandite (Barnes and others, 2006). In sulfide droplets  from the Medveszky Creek mine at Noril\u2019sk, which mainly  preserves a closed sulfide fractionation sequence, Barnes and  others (2006) concluded that Pd was mostly concentrated into  pentlandite; Os, Ir, Re, and Rh were concentrated into both  pyrrhotite and pentlandite that exsolved from MSS; and Au  and Pt were retained in the final fractionated liquid to form  discrete grains among ISS minerals.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Mungall and others (2005) suggested that devia- tions from an ideal sulfide fractionation path may best be  explained by adopting a model of equilibrium crystallization  for sulfide melt. Mungall (2007) has constructed an empirical  thermodynamic model for magmatic sulfide crystallization  supporting the conclusion that Ni is incompatible for all sul- fide magma compositions until very high Ni contents and very  low temperatures are reached. Mungall (2007) recommends  that all sulfides in a magmatic system be considered as cumu- lates rather than products derived from residual liquids.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Thus,  it is likely that the pattern of element distribution between  a sulfide liquid and silicate magma falls along a continuum  between fractional crystallization and equilibrium crystalliza- tion of the sulfide liquids, constrained by always unique physi- cal parameters and events.  A complication in parsing element partitioning behavior  among sulfide species based on observations of sulfide miner- als in silicate rocks is the fact that the mineral paragenesis and  suggested element distributions (fig. 7\u20131) may be radically  modified by later events. During final cooling, many elements  may diffuse into different sulfide phases, which complicate the  simple zoning patterns (fig. 7\u20131E). For example, at Voisey\u2019s  Bay, high-temperature hexagonal pyrrhotite recrystallized into  monoclinic pyrrhotite, and troilite exsolved from sulfur-poor  hexagonal pyrrhotite (Naldrett and others, 2000).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

This indicates that during  fractionation, the bulk of the Cu-rich sulfide liquid was dis- placed from crystallizing MSS (Naldrett and others, 2000).   At the Noril\u2019sk\u20131 deposit, massive Ni-rich ore and related   Cu-rich ore were mined, but an upper Cu-rich ore, typically  found at other deposits in the district, was missing, although  PGE-rich low-sulfide mineralization was well-developed  (Naldrett, 2004).

New magma pulses may partly  disaggregate and remelt previously formed sulfides or upgrade  metal tenor through interaction of early formed sulfide with  later batches of metal-bearing silicate magma (Kerr and  Leitch, 2005). Li and others (2009) suggested that an influx of  new, fertile magma interacting with sulfide was responsible   for upgrading of sulfide tenor, particularly for PGE, in the   Talnakh deposit, Noril\u2019sk. In the Jinchuan deposit, dissemi- nated sulfides that did not form a continuous network, particu- larly sulfides trapped near the margins of the ore bodies, have  lower Ni contents and form an envelope surrounding higher  grade ore. This suggests that metal contents of early formed  sulfides in the central parts of ore bodies were upgraded by  interaction with influxes of fresh magma (Chai and Naldrett,  1992).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

They pointed out that this scenario has important  implications for mineral assessment because metal-distribution  patterns in such a situation would not be informative of miner- alization potential. Because a late-stage Cu-rich liquid does not crystal- lize until its temperature is <850 \u00b0C, but an enclosing silicate  matrix becomes mostly solid by 1,000 \u00b0C, there can be a stark  contrast in the behavior of a sulfide liquid and its brittle sili- cate matrix under deformation stress.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The migration of residual Cu-rich liquids  may be enhanced because, with increasing Cu and decreasing  sulfur contents, those residual liquids develop strong wetting  abilities against silicates (Naldrett, 1969). The capacity for  redistribution of late-stage Cu-rich sulfides is an explanation  for the commonly reported occurrence of fractures and brec- cias filled with Cu-rich sulfides at many deposits, including  \u201cUpper Copper Ore\u201d at the Kharaelakh intrusion at Noril\u2019sk  (Naldrett and others, 1994).

Chai and Naldrett  (1992) described similar mineralogical zoning for the Jinchuan  deposit. In the western ore bodies at Jinchuan, Ni, Cu, and  PGE contents increase from the margins to the center of   the bodies.  Two types of mineral zoning, complex and simple, are  recognized in massive ores in the Talnakh area of Noril\u2019sk.

Those occur- rences indicate that the ores may have been injected at or near  the base of intrusions as separate pulses of massive sulfide  liquid or sulfide-rich breccias (Arndt and others, 2005). The  movement of dense sulfide liquids invoked for this mode of  occurrence suggests mobilization during structural readjust- ments or deformation along pre-existing structures.

Gossans  represent advanced chemical weathering in which sulfide  minerals are extensively oxidized and leached of most met- als, leaving behind hydrated iron oxides and, rarely, sulfates.  Gossans can be very large and may be targeted remotely using  various satellite and airborne multispectral and hyperspectral  data because iron oxides and hydrous iron oxides possess  distinctive spectral signatures in the VISNIR range (Hunt  and Ashley, 1979).

The timing of silicate crystallization can dictate sulfide  texture. Early crystallizing silicates, for example, may include  sulfide blebs as inclusions. In disseminated and matrix-textured  sulfide ores, sulfide-silicate contacts commonly suggest that  an early immiscible liquid sulfide was interstitial to silicate  cumulus phases. The relative timing of olivine crystalliza- tion and sulfide segregation can have a profound influence on  Ni content, with important implications for sulfide tenor. In a  mantle-derived melt, Ni partitions to both olivine and sul- fide liquid. If a sulfide liquid forms prior to crystallization of  olivine, then Ni is depleted in the silicate magma, but there is  no change in the FeO/MgO ratio of the magma.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

By normalizing metal contents of silicate rocks to primi- tive mantle, it is possible to distinguish among the patterns of  several mantle-derived magma types (for example, komatiites,  ocean floor basalts, high-MgO basalts, and ophiolitic chro- mitites). Likewise, by normalizing the metal contents of sul- fides to primitive mantle, it is possible to use the shape of the  normalized pattern to identify those sulfides that have sepa- rated from magmas that previously experienced some sulfide  segregation. When a sulfide liquid separates from a silicate   liquid, the resulting fractionated silicate liquid is depleted in  PGE compared to Ni and Cu because of the very strong affin- ity for PGE in sulfide versus silicate melts.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

However, sulfides from Voisey\u2019s Bay show significant deple- tion in PGE compared to Ni and Cu (Barnes and Lightfoot,  2005), suggesting that at least some of the magma had previ- ously undergone sulfide segregation that scavenged the PGE.

Although there are exceptions, in general a Pd/Ir ratio >100 sug- gests a hydrothermal origin, whereas a Pd/Ir ratio <100 suggests  a magmatic origin (Maier and others, 1998).

Thus, where  sulfides are substantially displaced towards higher Ni/Pd and  Cu/Ir and away from primary melt fields, as at Voisey\u2019s Bay,  it is possible to infer that the sulfides were segregated from a  magma from which an earlier episode of sulfide segregation  had already occurred, leaving behind a depleted silicate liquid.  This suggests that there may be PGE-rich sulfides present at  depth.

As a result, sulfur isotopes of the sulfide ore minerals com- monly reflect the highly variable sulfur sources of the country  rocks that the ultramafic to mafic magmas intrude.

Because typical mantle gOs values are near 0, this sug- gests that the primary magmas from which the ores segregated  were unlikely to have had much interaction with continental  lithosphere or crust. However, in order to explain the higher  gOs values of some ores at Wellgreen, Marcantonio and others  (1994) invoked the addition of radiogenic Os from surround- ing country rocks, via a hydrothermal fluid during emplace- ment of the intrusion, as a mechanism for altering primary  isotopic values. In the case of the Eagle deposit, Ding and  others (2008) suggested that the Os isotopic variation might  be related to late-stage hydrothermal processes accompanying  widespread serpentinization.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

These data suggest that a primary  basaltic magma strongly interacted with adjacent gneisses  (fig. 9\u20135; Lambert and others, 1999b, 2000).

The chondritic eNd value   (about 0) is consistent with the Nd isotopic signature of a  primitive mantle-derived magma, but the high initial 87Sr/86Sr  (>0.707) suggests that additional Sr may have been added after  emplacement (Naldrett, 2004).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

However, as noted by Hoatson and others (2006),  the presence of Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE mineralization shows no obvious   correlation with the composition or metamorphic grade of  basement lithologies. Thus, the importance of the country  rocks that host magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits lies not in their  chemical composition but in whether the rocks may contribute  to sulfur saturation of magma and to the physical controls that  country rocks may exert on intrusion dynamics.  In a closed system, fractional crystallization of magma  with low sulfur content will produce only a small volume of  sulfide minerals late in the crystallization sequence. To produce  sufficient sulfide to form a deposit, an external mechanism gen- erally is needed to induce sulfur saturation early in the crystal- lization process (Lightfoot and others, 1984; Arndt, 2005).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Two  possible external mechanisms have been identified: (1) addition  of sulfur to a magma either by bulk assimilation of sulfide- or  sulfate-bearing country rocks (for example, Noril\u2019sk: Naldrett,  1997; Voisey\u2019s Bay: Ripley and others, 2002) or by selective  uptake by magma of externally derived sulfur as a vapor or  fluid phase from surrounding country rocks (Ripley, 1981); and  (2) assimilation of felsic wall rocks during magmatic ascent,  thus increasing the silica content of the magma and thereby  reducing sulfur solubility and inducing sulfur saturation (for  example, Duluth Complex: Li and Naldrett, 1993; Nebo-Babel:  Hoatson and others, 2006; Seat and others, 2009). For some  deposits, both mechanisms may have played a role.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Li and  others (2009) have suggested that addition of external sulfur, as  well as addition of siliceous material to drive sulfur saturation,  were crucial for the development of the sulfide deposits   at Noril\u2019sk.  The sulfur content of crustal reservoirs plays an impor- tant role in determining whether a mafic-ultramafic magmatic  system will produce sulfide mineralization. Keays and Lightfoot  (2010) compared the unmineralized Deccan flood basalt system  to the Siberian flood basalts which host the Noril\u2019sk deposits  and determined that simply having significant crustal contami- nation of the magmatic system was not sufficient to produce  large Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits. Although a wide variety of  sedimentary and metamorphic rock types may interact with a  S-undersaturated magma (table 11\u20131), unless a threshold level  of sulfur is present within the crustal contaminant, the mag- matic system likely will not reach early sulfur saturation and  produce significant mineralization (Keays and Lightfoot, 2010).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

When magma reaches horizontally bedded sedimentary  strata in the upper crust, horizontal intrusions and sills tend to  form, such as at Noril\u2019sk (Naldrett, 2004), Kabanga (Maier and  others, 2010), Uitkomst (Li and others, 2002), and Wellgreen  (Marcantonio and others, 1994).

Theory of Deposit Formation  55 minerals are abundant. The common result is a small amount  of disseminated sulfide minerals among more abundant silicate  minerals; the sulfide minerals typically are insufficient both in  quantity and metal tenor to be economic. In addition, because  olivine commonly is the first phase to crystallize from most  mafic and ultramafic magmas upon cooling, the late-forming  disseminated sulfides exhibit relatively low Ni contents and  Ni/Cu ratios because olivine removes Ni from the silicate melt  as it crystallizes (Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005). Therefore, for- mation of sulfide-rich Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits requires that sulfur  saturation occurs relatively early in the crystallization history  of the magmas. For this to occur typically requires incorpora- tion of crustal sulfur (Li and others, 2001b, 2009).

In the first stage, a metal-bearing primitive  mafic or ultramafic parental magma is formed through partial  melting in hotter-than-normal parts of the mantle. That magma  typically represents the product of relatively high degrees of  partial melting (\u226520 to 25 percent), has large MgO content  (>12 weight percent), is relatively enriched in Ni and PGE,  and is sulfur-undersaturated during ascent from the mantle   and emplacement into the crust (Keays, 1995; Naldrett,   2010). Such primitive magmas are a common component  in most LIPs and are particularly prevalent early in a LIP\u2019s  magmatic history.

For that mantle  composition, the modeling showed that by 11 percent   melting, all sulfide present in the source had dissolved into   the silicate liquid. Therefore, as the percentage of mantle  melting increases above 11 percent, Pt, Pd, and Cu, originally  contained in mantle sulfide minerals, are diluted in the melt  and decrease in concentration, whereas the Ni content, origi- nally contained both in mantle sulfide and in olivine, continues  to increase in the melt. Further, although the melt may be  sulfur-saturated at the source, because of the negative effect of  pressure on sulfur solubility (Wendlandt, 1982) as the magma  rises, it will become undersaturated in sulfide upon emplace- ment into the crust.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

If the magma composition is  close to sulfide saturation upon emplacement, then sulfide  liquid may segregate deep in the crust, leaving ore metals  at depth and the remaining magma depleted in chalcophile  metals. Alternatively, strongly sulfide-undersaturated magmas  may rise to shallower levels in the crust but will require access  to large external amounts of sulfur to achieve sulfide satura- tion (Arndt and others, 2005). Sulfide-undersaturated magmas may interact with crustal  wall rocks during ascent and staging in subcrustal magma  chambers. Such interactions can form hybrid or contaminated  magmas with higher silica contents and also may result in  incorporation of crustal sulfur. Both processes can drive a  magma to sulfur saturation and cause the formation of an  immiscible sulfide liquid (Li and others, 2001b).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

For the efficient accumulation  of massive sulfide, it is important that sulfide saturation and  resultant sulfide liquid segregation occur early in the crystal- lization sequence, before abundant silicate minerals crystallize  and trap the sulfides. In addition, early sulfide saturation is  necessary because significant olivine crystallization prior to  formation of an immiscible sulfide liquid will deplete a silicate  liquid in Ni, thus limiting the quantity of Ni available to a  sulfide liquid (Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005; Naldrett, 2010).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Because of their very high partition coefficients, PGE  are extremely sensitive to removal of sulfides from silicate  melt. Thus, whereas a small amount of early crystallization  of olivine or sulfides will not lower the Ni content of the  magma significantly, removal of even small amounts of sulfide  will sharply deplete the PGE content and mildly deplete Cu  (Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005).

The Ni, Cu, and PGE contents of many ores  are higher than would be expected of sulfide that had separated  from the relatively small quantity of magma represented by  their host intrusions (Campbell and Naldrett, 1979). Therefore,  the sulfide liquid must have interacted with, and extracted ore  metals from, a larger volume of silicate magma. Such upgrad- ing is enhanced in magma conduit systems where previously  formed sulfide can interact with new pulses of undepleted  magma (Maier and others, 2001). Exactly how sulfide liquid  and new pulses of magma interact is not clear, however, and  may vary from deposit to deposit. Kerr and Leitch (2005)  noted that new pulses of undepleted magma likely would be  undersaturated in sulfide and, as a result, could be expected  not only to contribute chalcophile elements to the sulfides but  also to dissolve and remove sulfide.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Any decrease in upward velocity, however, could cause the  sulfide droplets to settle and pond. Therefore, structural traps,  where the flow velocity of magma is reduced, are important  sites for collection of sulfides. This includes embayments in  the footwall, where dense sulfide liquid can migrate downward  along the axis of the embayment and down the flanking sides  (as at Noril\u2019sk-Talnakh; Diakov and others, 2002), and where  a narrow feeder conduit enters a larger intrusion, resulting  in a decrease in flow velocity and preferential concentration  of sulfide droplets (for example, Voisey\u2019s Bay; Li and oth- ers, 2000). If deformation occurs before the sulfide liquid has  completely solidified, then residual sulfide liquid may migrate  or be injected into dilatant structures in the footwall (Barnes  and Lightfoot, 2005).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

In most cases, sulfide liquids have lower solidus tempera- tures than silicate melts and can fractionate as crystallization  proceeds with decreasing temperature (Naldrett, 2004). On  cooling, the first phase generally to crystallize from a sulfide  liquid is monosulfide solid solution (MSS, the Ni-bearing,  high-temperature equivalent of pyrrhotite). Experimental  studies of the partitioning of chalcophile metals between MSS  and sulfide liquid (Mungall and others, 2005, and references  therein) and observations on natural ores both show that  fractionation of a sulfide liquid results in enrichment of Cu,  Pt, Pd, and Au in residual liquid. If the resulting Cu-enriched  liquid escapes from the crystallizing MSS, then it can form  veins in dilatant structures in the footwall, such as at Noril\u2019sk  and Eagle.  13.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Acid  generated by oxidative weathering of pyrrhotite can aggres- sively attack other ore and gangue minerals, thereby liberat- ing a variety of potentially toxic elements, including metals  from sulfides and Al from silicates. Metal-laden acid-sulfate  waters can adversely affect surrounding surface water and  groundwater. Within the hydrologic system of mine workings  or mine wastes, minerals and other compounds, such as lime  used in flotation circuits, can neutralize acid generated by the  oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals. Thus, the chemistry  of drainage from a mine site is the result of the competing  processes of acid generation and acid neutralization. The oxidation of pyrrhotite and other sulfide minerals  proceeds with either dissolved oxygen (O2) or dissolved ferric  iron (Fe3+) as the oxidizing agent.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Commonly, pore waters show a step-decrease in pH  from 6.5\u20137.5, to 4.8\u20136.3, to 4.0\u20134.3, and finally to <3.5, which  corresponds to buffering by calcite, siderite, Al(OH)3, and  Fe(OH)3, respectively (Blowes and Ptacek, 1994; Jurjovec and  others, 2002; Blowes and others, 2003). Thus, despite being  a minor component of many of these mineralized systems,  carbonate minerals exert an important control on the geochem- istry of anoxic pore waters in tailing piles. Smelter slag is another important type of mine waste, and  the reactivity of slags is significant (Parsons and others, 2001;  Piatak and others, 2004; Piatak and Seal, 2010).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Mine Waste Characteristics Mineralogy The environmental characteristics of these deposits are  dominated by their significant acid-generating potential due to  the abundance of pyrrhotite, and their limited acid-neutralizing  potential due to the general absence or trace abundance of  carbonate minerals in their mineralization, alteration, and host  rock assemblages. Common sulfide minerals include pyrrhotite,  pyrite, chalcopyrite, and pentlandite. Common gangue minerals  include olivine, feldspar, pyroxene, quartz, chlorite, serpentine,  and minor amounts of calcite or dolomite. Secondary phases  include gypsum, magnetite, goethite, jarosite, native sulfur,  covellite, marcasite, siderite, and clay (McGregor and others,  1998; Johnson and others, 2000).\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Metal contamination can also be dispersed  downstream by the erosion and transport of tailings, which  subsequently release metals to the water column.  The toxicity of Ag, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn to aquatic  ecosystems is dependent on water hardness; toxicity limits of  these metals are higher at higher hardness values (U.S. Envi- ronmental Protection Agency, 2006). Hardness is primarily a  measure of the concentrations of Ca and Mg. The concentra- tion of hardness is expressed in terms of an equivalent concen- tration of CaCO3, typically in mg/L.

Copper is an essential micronutrient for humans,  whereas Ni is not. Human health effects of excessive Ni  exposure can include contact dermatitis, lung fibrosis, cardio- vascular and kidney disease, and cancer (nasal and lung); these  effects are most notable among Ni refinery workers (Denkhaus  and Salnikow, 2002; Cempel and Nikel, 2006). Environmental guidelines protecting human health from  drinking water and residential and industrial soils are sum- marized in table 14-1 for Ni and Cu, and a number of other  contaminants commonly associated with mine sites in general.

It remains  unclear, however, which of these two mechanisms is the  more important in producing sulfide saturation and ore  formation. Recently, Keays and Lightfoot (2010) have  suggested that crustal contamination without sulfur addi- tion is insufficient to achieve sulfide saturation and the  formation of magmatic Ni-Cu sulfide deposits. 2.

Although there is evidence that metal tenors of many  ores are higher than would be expected of sulfide that  had segregated from the quantity of magma represented  by related small host intrusions (Campbell and Neldrett,  1979), exactly how magma interacts with sulfide is not  clear and may vary from deposit to deposit. For example,  in order to achieve large metal enrichments observed in  the Noril\u2019sk disseminated sulfides, large R factors (1,000  to 10,000) are required (Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005),  implying an extremely dynamic, open, magmatic system.  Droplets of sulfide have a large surface area-to-volume  ratio that promotes scavenging of chalcophile elements as  droplets are transported by flowing magma. Once sulfide  droplets are deposited in a layer (which would have a low  surface area-to-volume ratio), however, the droplets no  longer would extract chalcophile elements efficiently from  overlying silicate melt.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

This suggests that achieving high  magma-to-sulfide ratios (high R factors) probably requires  continued suspension and mixing of sulfide droplets with  silicate melt. Alternatively, Kerr and Leitch (2005) suggest  that the most effective way to significantly increase metal  tenors is by resorption of sulfide liquid by new injections  of sulfide-undersaturated silicate magma. 4. Massive or brecciated ores at several sulfide deposits,  including Noril\u2019sk, Jinchuan, Voisey\u2019s Bay, and Eagle,  appear locally to transgress their host rocks and to have  Cu/Pd ratios and PGE abundances different from associ- ated disseminated mineralization. Those ores perhaps  were injected as separate pulses of massive sulfide liquid  or sulfide-rich breccia, generally along the base of host  intrusions.\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

The transgressive relation  may have resulted from mobilization of still-molten   sulfide liquid during structural readjustments around   the host intrusion; this alone, however, would not   account for compositional differences from associated  disseminated mineralization. 5. Are parental magmas to sulfide-rich Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits  typically enriched in ore metals, or do ore-forming pro- cesses depend more on the magmatic history of mantle- derived magmas, particularly the manner in which they  interact with crustal rocks during their passage to the   surface?\n\nIs this paragraph talking about any of the mineral system components?

Komati- itic, tholeiitic, and alkaline mafic and ultramafic magmas  all have sufficiently high metal contents to form deposits,  yet only komatiites and tholeiitic picrites appear to host  significant Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits (Arndt and   others, 2005).
