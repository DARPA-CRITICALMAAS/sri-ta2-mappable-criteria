The Mohorovicic discontinuity or 'Moho' maps the boundary between the earth's crust and mantle and is defined by an abrupt change in seismic velocity due to changes in the density of rocks between the crust and mantle. ###Depth to Mohorovičić discontinuity or Moho (km)###Seismic_Moho_GEMMA

0.5888875643037215,Geophysics###Gravity###Proximity to gravity worms (pixels; calculated from raster with 0.01 degree grid). Otherwise known as “worms”, the points tracking the maxima mark the edges of shallow density sources (in the case of the Bouguer gravity) and deeper density sources (calculated from the upward continued gravity). The shapefile of worms also includes attribute fields related to the steepness of the gradient and to the trend or strike of the gradient. ###Proximity to gravity worms (pixels; calculated from raster with 0.01 degree grid)###Gravity_Bouguer_HGM_Worms_Proximity

The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB), calculated from calibrated surface wave tomography models, is marked by an abrupt change in seismic velocity between the earth's cooler lithosphere (higher seismic velocities) and the warmer and more ductile asthenosphere (lower seismic velocities). The LAB gradient is interpreted to represent a change from thicker to thinner lithosphere.###Depth to lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB; km). ###Seismic_LAB_Hoggard
