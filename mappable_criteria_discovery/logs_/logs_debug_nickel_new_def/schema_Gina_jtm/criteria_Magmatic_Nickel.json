Most of the remainder of  \nthe Ni production is derived from lateritic deposits, which form \nby weathering of ultramafic rocks in humid tropical conditions \n(Elias, 2002; Freyssinet and others, 2005). Magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE \nsulfide deposits are spatially and genetically related to bodies of \nmafic and/or ultramafic rocks. The sulfide deposits form when \nthe mantle-derived mafic and/or ultramafic magmas become \nsulfide-saturated and segregate immiscible sulfide liquid, \ncommonly following interaction with continental crustal rocks \n(Arndt and others, 2005).\nDeposits of magmatic Ni-Cu sulfides occur with mafic and/\nor ultramafic bodies emplaced in diverse geologic settings.",

Likewise, by normalizing the metal contents of sul-\nfides to primitive mantle, it is possible to use the shape of the \nnormalized pattern to identify those sulfides that have sepa-\nrated from magmas that previously experienced some sulfide \nsegregation.

Therefore, as the percentage of mantle \nmelting increases above 11 percent, Pt, Pd, and Cu, originally \ncontained in mantle sulfide minerals, are diluted in the melt \nand decrease in concentration, whereas the Ni content, origi-\nnally contained both in mantle sulfide and in olivine, continues \nto increase in the melt.

Keays and Lightfoot \n(2010) compared the unmineralized Deccan flood basalt system \nto the Siberian flood basalts which host the Noril\u2019sk deposits \nand determined that simply having significant crustal contami-\nnation of the magmatic system was not sufficient to produce \nlarge Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits. Although a wide variety of \nsedimentary and metamorphic rock types may interact with a \nS-undersaturated magma (table 11\u20131), unless a threshold level \nof sulfur is present within the crustal contaminant, the mag-\nmatic system likely will not reach early sulfur saturation and \nproduce significant mineralization (Keays and Lightfoot, 2010).",

Thus, the importance of the country \nrocks that host magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits lies not in their \nchemical composition but in whether the rocks may contribute \nto sulfur saturation of magma and to the physical controls that \ncountry rocks may exert on intrusion dynamics. \nIn a closed system, fractional crystallization of magma \nwith low sulfur content will produce only a small volume of \nsulfide minerals late in the crystallization sequence.

Some \nof these offsets were attributed to deep crustal-penetrating \nfaults that, according to Rempel (1994), might have served as \nconduits for ore-forming magmas.\nRecent seismic-reflection-profiling studies, such as those \ncoordinated by the Canadian Lithoprobe Project (Clowes, \n2010), have greatly dispelled some of the old prejudices \nregarding seismic applications for mineral deposits in igne-\nous and metamorphic terranes. Recent investigations have \nrevealed that sulfide minerals and their host rocks can have \nlarge contrasts in acoustic impedance (fig. 6\u20135), and that \nmany massive sulfide occurrences should be associated with \ndetectable reflection or diffraction signatures, provided that \nthe seismic data are properly acquired and processed (Salis-\nbury and Snyder, 2007).",

A subsequent extensive microscopic \nstudy of the Sudbury ores by Wandke and Hoffman (1924)  \nalso led them to conclude that the deposits were hydrothermal \nin origin. \nAs noted by Naldrett (2005), arguments about the mag-\nmatic versus hydrothermal origin of the Sudbury ores persisted \nthrough most of the first half of the twentieth century, with \nthose mapping and studying the SIC favoring a magmatic \norigin and those most familiar with the mines favoring a hydro-\nthermal origin.

This suggests that achieving high \nmagma-to-sulfide ratios (high R factors) probably requires \ncontinued suspension and mixing of sulfide droplets with \nsilicate melt. Alternatively, Kerr and Leitch (2005) suggest \nthat the most effective way to significantly increase metal \ntenors is by resorption of sulfide liquid by new injections \nof sulfide-undersaturated silicate magma.\n4. Massive or brecciated ores at several sulfide deposits, \nincluding Noril\u2019sk, Jinchuan, Voisey\u2019s Bay, and Eagle, \nappear locally to transgress their host rocks and to have \nCu/Pd ratios and PGE abundances different from associ-\nated disseminated mineralization. Those ores perhaps \nwere injected as separate pulses of massive sulfide liquid \nor sulfide-rich breccia, generally along the base of host \nintrusions.",

Geoenvironmental Features \nWeathering Processes\nModern weathering processes operating on mine wastes \nfrom sulfide deposits result in acid generation and mobility of \nmetals.

The geochemistry of acid-\nmine drainage was reviewed by Nordstrom and Alpers (1999), \nand additional aspects of the weathering of a variety of ore and \ngangue minerals were discussed by Plumlee (1999).
