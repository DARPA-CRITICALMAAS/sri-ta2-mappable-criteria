Many of the intrusive magmatic systems occur at sub- volcanic levels in the crust, and contact alteration and meta- morphism of the host rock commonly occur adjacent to both  mineralized and unmineralized intrusions. It was noted early  during exploration in the Noril\u2019sk area, however, that unminer- alized intrusions generally are surrounded by relatively   thin, low-temperature hornfels aureoles, whereas ore-bearing  intrusions have higher temperature hornfels aureoles 1.5 to   2.5 times as thick as the intrusion itself (fig. 5\u20134; Diakov and  others, 2002).\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9Bvybcqww2h68H6pmXGOP4jspK1F6", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631497, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mappable proxy: Thickness and temperature of hornfels aureoles surrounding intrusions (thicker and higher temperature aureoles associated with ore-bearing intrusions)."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens": 31, "total_tokens": 468}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-26-2", "component": "preservation"}]

Introduction  Overview Magmatic sulfide deposits containing nickel (Ni) and   copper (Cu), with or without (\u00b1) platinum-group elements  (PGE), account for approximately 60 percent of the world\u2019s  nickel production (Naldrett, 2004). Most of the remainder of   the Ni production is derived from lateritic deposits, which form  by weathering of ultramafic rocks in humid tropical conditions  (Elias, 2002; Freyssinet and others, 2005). Magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide deposits are spatially and genetically related to bodies of  mafic and/or ultramafic rocks. The sulfide deposits form when  the mantle-derived mafic and/or ultramafic magmas become  sulfide-saturated and segregate immiscible sulfide liquid,  commonly following interaction with continental crustal rocks  (Arndt and others, 2005). Deposits of magmatic Ni-Cu sulfides occur with mafic and/ or ultramafic bodies emplaced in diverse geologic settings.\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvybZneNSmCVBvLs2TW8LGWjwp8O", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631497, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features related to the source of magmatic nickel deposits could be the distribution of mafic and ultramafic bodies emplaced in diverse geologic settings."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens": 40, "total_tokens": 505}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-12-0", "component": "source"}]

Three\u2013dimensional seismic imaging of a sill by  Trude and others (2004) revealed a complex of ridges along  the top of one sill that appear to indicate magma flow. These  ridges, with wavelengths of 220 to 350 meters and amplitudes  of 25 to 50 m, were likely created by viscous drag near the top  of the sill and appear to radiate from distinct feeder zones   (fig. 6\u20139). Sill geometry, as well as magma flow, is impor- tant to the development of dike- and sill-hosted Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide deposits, particularly near feeder zones. The seismic  studies in the Faroe-Shetland Basin indicate that three-  dimensional seismic imaging may be a powerful tool for   recognizing intrusion geometry and identifying magma   feeder systems.\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvybrHqUhh5iSD63DmsTq9DOnjWE", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631497, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mappable proxy: Three-dimensional seismic imaging of ridges along the top of sills indicating magma flow and feeder zones."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens": 24, "total_tokens": 473}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-34-5", "component": "pathway"}]

Not surprisingly, magnetic  surveying has been used extensively in the search for these  deposits in Canada (Ford and others, 2007; King, 2007; Balch  and others, 2010), and it has apparently also played a signifi- cant role in the discovery of the Eagle and Tamarack deposits  in the United States (Ware and others, 2008; Boerboom, 2009;  Ding and others, 2010).

The migration of residual Cu-rich liquids  may be enhanced because, with increasing Cu and decreasing  sulfur contents, those residual liquids develop strong wetting  abilities against silicates (Naldrett, 1969).

General acceptance of a magmatic origin for Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE  sulfide ores at Sudbury led to the model that magmatic sulfide  ore bodies form along the base of large, layered mafic intru- sions owing to gravitational settling of a dense sulfide liquid  segregated from the parental magmas upon emplacement.\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9Bvyb4A59NcOa8rZDJYQ5of7ocnvH", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631497, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features related to the source of the Magmatic Nickel deposit type could be the distribution and geometry of large, layered mafic intrusions."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens": 36, "total_tokens": 501}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-18-5", "component": "source"}]

Geophysical Signatures  Introduction Magmatic sulfide-rich Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits, generally  hosted by relatively small picrite or tholeiitic basalt dike-sill  complexes, present some unique challenges to geophysical  exploration. Because these types of deposits involve some  combination of pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and chalcopyrite (Ford  and others, 2007), they typically are associated with highly  anomalous physical properties, including density, magneti- zation, electrical conductivity, electrical chargeability, and  acoustic velocity.

By normalizing metal contents of silicate rocks to primi- tive mantle, it is possible to distinguish among the patterns of  several mantle-derived magma types (for example, komatiites,  ocean floor basalts, high-MgO basalts, and ophiolitic chro- mitites). Likewise, by normalizing the metal contents of sul- fides to primitive mantle, it is possible to use the shape of the  normalized pattern to identify those sulfides that have sepa- rated from magmas that previously experienced some sulfide  segregation. When a sulfide liquid separates from a silicate   liquid, the resulting fractionated silicate liquid is depleted in  PGE compared to Ni and Cu because of the very strong affin- ity for PGE in sulfide versus silicate melts.\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvybQm3Hunl3l0zvhjwUf4bWnF9k", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631497, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features related to the source of Magmatic Nickel deposits is the distribution of key minerals and rock types, particularly focusing on the presence of sulfide minerals and their relationship to the associated silicate rocks."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens": 47, "total_tokens": 526}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-50-0", "component": "source"}]

Olivine that  crystallizes after sulfide separation will be depleted in Ni, with  no change in its major element chemistry. In contrast, early  crystallization of olivine will deplete magma in Ni and increase  its FeO/MgO ratio. Thus, olivine chemistry can provide clues  to a mafic body\u2019s silicate/sulfide crystallization sequence and  provide an assessment/exploration tool. Li and others (2001b)  also pointed out that pervasive Ni depletion by early crystal- lization of olivine prior to sulfide immiscibility may result in  development of Ni-depleted sulfide of questionable economic  value. An example of this effect may be the Katahdin pyrrhotite  body, hosted within a gabbro stock in northern Maine (Miller,  1945).\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvybRtVL29Nm8fU9ookKWcN9FOmW", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631497, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features related to the trap of the Magmatic Nickel deposit type is the chemistry of olivine, specifically looking for clues to the mafic body\u2019s silicate/sulfide crystallization sequence and assessing the potential for Ni-depleted sulfide formation."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 465, "completion_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 524}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-49-2", "component": "trap"}]

First, crustal struc- ture helps control the formation of magma chambers, defin- ing sites where ascending magmas can be trapped at density  discontinuities in the crust (Arndt, 2005). When ascending  magma reaches horizontally bedded sedimentary strata,  magma can spread out along bedding planes, and horizontal  intrusions or sills typically form. If magma intrudes along  successively higher bedding planes, a series of upward- stepping sills will form complexes of stacked, saucer-shaped  intrusions (Chevallier and Woodford, 1999).\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9Bvyb0R7bXUqixYVUzqQJDXq2cfNf", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631497, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mappable proxy: Distribution of fine-grained basalt, diabase, medium- and coarse-grained cumulate rocks, gabbro, pegmatite, and breccia, as well as the presence of changes in footwall geometry affecting magma flow dynamics and the relationship to sedimentary rocks, including basement metamorphic rocks and upper crustal sedimentary rocks."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 471, "completion_tokens": 75, "total_tokens": 546}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-23-3", "component": "pathway"}]

Acid  generated by oxidative weathering of pyrrhotite can aggres- sively attack other ore and gangue minerals, thereby liberat- ing a variety of potentially toxic elements, including metals  from sulfides and Al from silicates. Metal-laden acid-sulfate  waters can adversely affect surrounding surface water and  groundwater. Within the hydrologic system of mine workings  or mine wastes, minerals and other compounds, such as lime  used in flotation circuits, can neutralize acid generated by the  oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals. Thus, the chemistry  of drainage from a mine site is the result of the competing  processes of acid generation and acid neutralization.

Thus, upgrading of metal  tenors likely requires the intimate mixing of silicate magma  and sulfide liquid on a droplet scale. To form an economic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposit, a  sufficient quantity of metal-rich sulfide liquid must become  concentrated in a restricted locality (Maier and others, 2001).  Because the densities of sulfide liquids (about 4 to 5 g/cm3) are  greater than that of silicate magmas within which they develop  (about 2.8 to 3.4 g/cm3; table 6\u20132), sulfide droplets will tend  to settle in a silicate melt unless impeded by such factors as  the presence of phenocrysts, melt viscosity, surface tension,  or melt transport velocity (Mungall and Su, 2005; Chung and  Mungall, 2009).\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9Bvye1ljxeB1kawSi46CVVp0myoIB", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631500, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features described in the paragraph could be the presence and distribution of phenocrysts in the host rock."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 489, "completion_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 517}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-67-2", "component": "trap"}]

When magma reaches horizontally bedded sedimentary  strata in the upper crust, horizontal intrusions and sills tend to  form, such as at Noril\u2019sk (Naldrett, 2004), Kabanga (Maier and  others, 2010), Uitkomst (Li and others, 2002), and Wellgreen  (Marcantonio and others, 1994).

Post-emplacement  cataclastic metamorphism may remobilize, and possibly dis- perse, sulfide ores, as in the development of matrix-brecciated  sulfides at Pechenga (Naldrett, 2004) or the remobilization of  sulfides along shear zones as at the Kabanga deposit (Maier and  Figure 10\u20134.

Naldrett (2010) modeled the melting of a representative  mantle composition at low (15 kb) pressure. For that mantle  composition, the modeling showed that by 11 percent   melting, all sulfide present in the source had dissolved into   the silicate liquid. Therefore, as the percentage of mantle  melting increases above 11 percent, Pt, Pd, and Cu, originally  contained in mantle sulfide minerals, are diluted in the melt  and decrease in concentration, whereas the Ni content, origi- nally contained both in mantle sulfide and in olivine, continues  to increase in the melt. Further, although the melt may be  sulfur-saturated at the source, because of the negative effect of  pressure on sulfur solubility (Wendlandt, 1982) as the magma  rises, it will become undersaturated in sulfide upon emplace- ment into the crust.\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvyelTxudUjkL6hJGaFq95N3uys0", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631500, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features described in the paragraph could be the distribution of primitive magmas and their associated sulfide minerals within Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs)."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens": 39, "total_tokens": 494}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-66-2", "component": "source"}]

Li and  others (2009) have suggested that addition of external sulfur, as  well as addition of siliceous material to drive sulfur saturation,  were crucial for the development of the sulfide deposits   at Noril\u2019sk.  The sulfur content of crustal reservoirs plays an impor- tant role in determining whether a mafic-ultramafic magmatic  system will produce sulfide mineralization. Keays and Lightfoot  (2010) compared the unmineralized Deccan flood basalt system  to the Siberian flood basalts which host the Noril\u2019sk deposits  and determined that simply having significant crustal contami- nation of the magmatic system was not sufficient to produce  large Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits. Although a wide variety of  sedimentary and metamorphic rock types may interact with a  S-undersaturated magma (table 11\u20131), unless a threshold level  of sulfur is present within the crustal contaminant, the mag- matic system likely will not reach early sulfur saturation and  produce significant mineralization (Keays and Lightfoot, 2010).\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvyentoV79gJQt3dlnR3sOcQ6hSm", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631500, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features related to the source of magmatic nickel deposits could be the distribution of sulfur-rich crustal contaminants interacting with mafic-ultramafic magmatic systems."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 484, "completion_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 525}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-64-4", "component": "source"}]

However, as noted by Hoatson and others (2006),  the presence of Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE mineralization shows no obvious   correlation with the composition or metamorphic grade of  basement lithologies. Thus, the importance of the country  rocks that host magmatic Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits lies not in their  chemical composition but in whether the rocks may contribute  to sulfur saturation of magma and to the physical controls that  country rocks may exert on intrusion dynamics.  In a closed system, fractional crystallization of magma  with low sulfur content will produce only a small volume of  sulfide minerals late in the crystallization sequence. To produce  sufficient sulfide to form a deposit, an external mechanism gen- erally is needed to induce sulfur saturation early in the crystal- lization process (Lightfoot and others, 1984; Arndt, 2005).\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvyerUEbWmLTXjsW0egi1AzPGFDc", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631500, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mappable proxy representing the geological features related to the source of magmatic nickel deposits:\n- Presence of rocks that may contribute to sulfur saturation of magma\n- Physical controls exerted by country rocks on intrusion dynamics"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 481, "completion_tokens": 41, "total_tokens": 522}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-64-2", "component": "source"}]

Such upgrad- ing is enhanced in magma conduit systems where previously  formed sulfide can interact with new pulses of undepleted  magma (Maier and others, 2001). Exactly how sulfide liquid  and new pulses of magma interact is not clear, however, and  may vary from deposit to deposit.

Alternatively, strongly sulfide-undersaturated magmas  may rise to shallower levels in the crust but will require access  to large external amounts of sulfur to achieve sulfide satura- tion (Arndt and others, 2005). Sulfide-undersaturated magmas may interact with crustal  wall rocks during ascent and staging in subcrustal magma  chambers. Such interactions can form hybrid or contaminated  magmas with higher silica contents and also may result in  incorporation of crustal sulfur.

In most cases, sulfide liquids have lower solidus tempera- tures than silicate melts and can fractionate as crystallization  proceeds with decreasing temperature (Naldrett, 2004). On  cooling, the first phase generally to crystallize from a sulfide  liquid is monosulfide solid solution (MSS, the Ni-bearing,  high-temperature equivalent of pyrrhotite). Experimental  studies of the partitioning of chalcophile metals between MSS  and sulfide liquid (Mungall and others, 2005, and references  therein) and observations on natural ores both show that  fractionation of a sulfide liquid results in enrichment of Cu,  Pt, Pd, and Au in residual liquid.

Theory of Deposit Formation  55 minerals are abundant. The common result is a small amount  of disseminated sulfide minerals among more abundant silicate  minerals; the sulfide minerals typically are insufficient both in  quantity and metal tenor to be economic. In addition, because  olivine commonly is the first phase to crystallize from most  mafic and ultramafic magmas upon cooling, the late-forming  disseminated sulfides exhibit relatively low Ni contents and  Ni/Cu ratios because olivine removes Ni from the silicate melt  as it crystallizes (Barnes and Lightfoot, 2005). Therefore, for- mation of sulfide-rich Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE deposits requires that sulfur  saturation occurs relatively early in the crystallization history  of the magmas. For this to occur typically requires incorpora- tion of crustal sulfur (Li and others, 2001b, 2009).

Secondary metal-sulfate salts that commonly accumu- late as intermediate products of sulfide oxidation also will  contribute acidity (Alpers and others, 1994; Cravotta, 1994;  Hammarstrom and others, 2001).\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvyfMDpv6fmLOUKWwr9ihkyb14Dw", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631501, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features related to the source of magmatic nickel deposits could be the distribution of key minerals such as pyrite, pyrrhotite, and calcite, as well as the presence of secondary metal-sulfate salts as intermediate products of sulfide oxidation."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 461, "completion_tokens": 59, "total_tokens": 520}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-73-8", "component": "source"}]

Arndt and others (2005) have suggested  that the absence of deposits in alkaline sequences reflects  the rapid ascent of alkaline magmas through the crust  because of their volatile-rich, low-density character.\n\nSummarize the paragraph above into a list of one mappable proxy that represent the geological features.\nAnswer: \n"}], "temperature": 0}, {"id": "chatcmpl-9BvygG9e6a2e7lpVQ7ogIzz5BqSFk", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1712631502, "model": "gpt-3.5-turbo-1106", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "The mappable proxy that represents the geological features related to the source of Magmatic Nickel deposits could be the distribution of basaltic sequences enriched in chalcophile elements, particularly focusing on komatiitic and tholeiitic picrites, which are known to host significant Ni-Cu\u00b1PGE sulfide deposits."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens": 64, "total_tokens": 501}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_592ef5907d"}, {"node_id": "SIR2010-5070i-77-3", "component": "source"}]

The definition for trap is Geochemical (fluid/magma mixing, fractional crystallization, phase immiscibility, fluid rock interaction, etc.) and physical (decompression, density separation, etc.) processes that operate at the trap or metal deposition site and cause metal deposition from a fluid/ magma in a host rock or structure..\n\nThese formation processes generally are not observable directly for the mineral systems being investigated, and so for the purposes of spatial modelling it needs to be translated into one or more observable and mappable geological features, which are called 'mappable criteria'. Examples for mappable features: distribution of key minerals and rock types, presence of faults, craton edges, metamorphic grade, ages of rocks, magnetic anomalies.\n\nHere is a paragraph from an academic paper that might be related to the trap of the Magmatic Nickel deposit type:\n80  Occurrence Model for Magmatic Sulfide-Rich Nickel-Copper Deposits Zhang, X., Pirajno, F., Qin, D., Fan, Z., Liu, G., and Nian,  H., 2006, Baimazhai, Yunnan Province, China\u2014A hydro- thermally modified magmatic nickel-copper-PGE sulfide  deposit: International Geology Review, v. 48, p. 725\u2013741.
